        "html": "<p> <br /></p>\n\n<h2>\n</h2><p>People argue endlessly about which of the Big Two economic systems is better and fairer, but there’s more out there besides Capitalism and Communism.</p>\n<p>Having witnessed a great many online discussions rapidly decay in a spittle-flecked, frenetic combination of ignorance and strong emotion due to the absence of any concept of the various economic systems that have existed through space and time, aside from the Big Two (of course), it is this author’s fervent hope that endeavoring to shed light upon such systems, even in an incomplete and partial way, will assist the public imagination and improve our national conversation, leading to more creative economic outcomes. Many of the loudest American voices seem attached to minds which can only think in binary terms: white/black, Democrat/Republican, Capitalist/Communist, freedom/slavery, good/evil. How much more there is, for those who care to see! Beyond capitalism lies more than just “it must be Communism,” and it’s worth exploring ideas that have served other human societies in order to conceive new systems for our future.</p>\n<p>First, however, it is prudent to come to adequate agreement as to what those first two words mean.</p>\n<p>These days, it seems that both words – Capitalism and Communism – have come to mean something other than ways of organizing an economy and distributing the goods produced therein. <a href=\"http://www.historyworld.net/wrldhis/plaintexthistories.asp?historyid=aa49\">Capitalism</a>, then, relates to an economy based upon the accumulation and investment of particularly large piles of wealth to generate economic returns, a meaning utterly lost when the term has been watered down to something more akin to “freedom” or “warm, good, happy feelings of positivity.” Capitalism <a href=\"https://news.mikecallicrate.com/gods-and-radicals-neither-capitalism-nor-socialism-a-third-alternative/\">isn’t the same</a> as simply having markets or engaging in trade. Although elements of capitalism are evident in, say, the forbidden medieval practice of usury (lending money to be repaid with interest), it really came into its own with such innovations as the chartered <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/0f1ec9da-c9a6-11e9-af46-b09e8bfe60c0\">East India Company</a> in the 18th century, which began the process of ravaging the subcontinent for private profit.</p>\n<p>Likewise, “communism” has come to mean “bad, evil things that inspire feelings of unhappiness” rather than “an economic system in which the major means of production are <a href=\"https://www.britannica.com/topic/communism\">owned and controlled by the public</a>,” with the aim of a classless, stateless society. In 20th century practice, this has often meant a state-controlled economy, though today’s anarchist-communists envision <a href=\"https://libcom.org/article/anarchist-communism-introduction\">independent, egalitarian communities</a> managing their own economic needs. Doubtless, private owners of capital would prefer that the idea of public collectivization of wealth be widely associated with grim, fearful feelings (similar to the way many economically disadvantaged poors feel about the word “capitalism” these days), but such emotional redefinition does little to advance the worthy goal of creating an economy that works for as many people as possible (and, importantly, doesn’t destroy the natural world on which our lives depend).</p>\n<a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.legalreader.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Karl_Marx_1875.jpg?ssl=1\"><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.legalreader.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Karl_Marx_1875.jpg?resize=300%2C380&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"Vintage photograph of a man with bushy, white hair and beard, seated, wearing formal clothes.\" width=\"300\" height=\"380\" /></a>Karl Marx, acknowledged father of revolutionary communist theory. Photo by John Jabez Edwin Mayall, colored by Olga Shirnina, courtesy of Wikimedia Commons. CC BY-SA 2.0<p>So, beyond capitalism and communism, what is there? How else could an economy possibly be organized?</p>\n<p>Perhaps the oldest system is the <a href=\"https://maggieappleton.com/gift-economy\">gift economy</a>. When humans lived together in small bands, often at least partially nomadic, one depended upon one’s tribe to live. Food was shared; there were social rules about how to parcel out a hunter’s kill. Those who accumulated too much or acted too greedily may have been <a href=\"https://www.sapiens.org/culture/hunter-gatherer-inequality-namibia/\">mocked and humbled</a> by their peers, ensuring that resources were spread widely. Gifts of food, tools, or other objects were regularly exchanged, and while everyone knew the score, not reciprocating similarly at some point was shameful. If you’ve ever attended a seed swap, a supper club, or even Christmas morning, you’ve taken part in a gift economy, where the best way to invest one’s excess is in one’s friends.</p>\n<p>Later came the <a href=\"https://ecotalker.wordpress.com/2020/09/16/totw-palace-economy/\">palace economy</a>. Greater control of a larger population enabled central elites to organize the production and distribution of goods. Land and materials may be provided, such as in the Inca Empire, where different villages were assigned different kinds of production. Finished goods would be collected at a central location, such as a palace or <a href=\"https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/iraq/article/abs/origins-of-the-templeeconomy-as-seen-in-the-light-of-prehistoric-evidence/E6CED755CA475E624BFCD64BAB3B2212\">temple</a> (since state and religious power were mingled, a condition some among us would prefer even now). Authorities would then redistribute the goods as they saw fit, whether around the kingdom to those that needed them, as trade goods with other polities, gifts to form alliances, financing a military, or what have you. A similar modern equivalent might be <a href=\"https://archive.foodfirst.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/PB11-Famine-in-North-Korea-Christine-Ahn.pdf\">North Korea’s version of state communism</a>, where the government decides what grains farmers are to grow, and redistributes whatever grain is produced back to the people “according to need” (and availability).</p>\n<p>You likely heard about the next one in school: <a href=\"https://www.worldhistory.org/Feudalism/\">feudalism</a>, the dominant economic system of medieval Europe, among other regions. Land (the most important means of production) was owned by the monarch, who lent control of it to the nobility in exchange for the promise of military support in war. Nobility lent smaller parcels to knights, who promised to fight. Knights then provided peasantry with land, in exchange for labor and a share of produce. The details and customs varied from place to place, of course, and the Church complicated it even more, but however <a href=\"https://www.worldhistory.org/image/15424/the-feudal-society-in-medieval-europe/\">hierarchal</a> and oppressive, feudalism was a relatively efficient answer to the circumstances of the time. Nowadays, <a href=\"https://lareviewofbooks.org/article/neofeudalism-the-end-of-capitalism/\">we don’t have to look far</a> for the modern equivalent of a low-mobility landless underclass who serve their more wealthy ‘betters.’</p>\n<p>Indigenous tribes of the salmon-rich Pacific Northwest devised <a href=\"https://www.law.gmu.edu/assets/files/publications/working_papers/1605.pdf\">the potlatch economy</a>. Any chief who wanted to remain in that position would do so by ordering a potlatch ceremony and inviting outsiders to attend. By commanding as much production of feast foods and gifts as that tribe could afford, and giving it away in abundance during the ceremony, the chief could earn prestige as the richest and most generous, the rightful big man. As in the gift economy, a mental tally was kept and reciprocity expected, with any shortfall resulting in the loss of political prestige. Organized as a way of allocating political power, it was also an effective way of distributing goods from those with more to those with less.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://distributistreview.com/archive/an-introduction-to-distributism\">Distributism</a> is a lesser-known economic philosophy with its roots in Catholicism. Rather than the means of production being concentrated in the hands of the rich, or run by a government bureaucracy, the main goal of distributism is to <a href=\"https://modjourn.org/essay/distributism/\">spread the ownership of property and the means of production as widely as possible</a>. This could <a href=\"https://static1.squarespace.com/static/5e486131a9ec956ab43c1f8e/5e4862202773074a5cd60bb2/5e4862232773074a5cd60de4/1581802019229/wallst.pdf?format=original\">mean</a> a great many mom-and-pop shops, worker-owned co-ops, small diverse farms, and independent contractors. Sure, the lack of vast accumulations of capital would mean fewer giant corporations, but that price might be worth paying if it means that everyone had the means to sustain themselves.</p>\n<p>Socialism has become as emotionally loaded a term as capitalism or communism, but what is it really? Opinions vary, but in the democratic socialist, Nordic model held up by the likes of Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, there’s still a capitalist, market economy. Some of the most essential human needs, which aren’t always met by the market, are simply <a href=\"https://jacobin.com/2020/05/capitalism-socialism-cooperatives-market-nhs-democracy\">made available alongside and outside</a> of it, funded by public taxation (that is, <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/2016/9/1/12732168/economic-freedom-score-america-welfare-state\">skimming a bit of the productivity off of a capitalist economy</a> in order to make it serve more people). Major examples would be the British National Health Service, social security payments to the elderly, or state-owned banks that do not need to operate at a profit because their mission is more human-centric.</p>\n<p>As you can see, beyond capitalism and communism lies an impressive array of other ways to live. In practice, no single economic system takes care of all needs perfectly. We live in such a mix, where we may work for a capitalist, receive food assistance benefits (SNAP) to subsidize an insufficient wage, trade baby clothes with a moms’ group, and take advantage of a community garden plot or CSA share.</p>\n<p>Looking around, however, it’s easy to see that the dominant form of American capitalism isn’t working for everyone. There are homeless people and people-less homes. Vast amounts of food are wasted, yet there are hungry people. We’re destroying the landbase and creating mountains of trash. Increasingly, people are impatient to find a better way, although their imaginations usually <a href=\"https://news.mikecallicrate.com/gods-and-radicals-neither-capitalism-nor-socialism-a-third-alternative/\">settle into two</a> opposing and circularly-arguing camps.

        "text": "People argue endlessly about which of the Big Two economic systems is better and fairer, but there’s more out there besides Capitalism and Communism.\nHaving witnessed a great many online discussions rapidly decay in a spittle-flecked, frenetic combination of ignorance and strong emotion due to the absence of any concept of the various economic systems that have existed through space and time, aside from the Big Two (of course), it is this author’s fervent hope that endeavoring to shed light upon such systems, even in an incomplete and partial way, will assist the public imagination and improve our national conversation, leading to more creative economic outcomes. Many of the loudest American voices seem attached to minds which can only think in binary terms: white/black, Democrat/Republican, Capitalist/Communist, freedom/slavery, good/evil. How much more there is, for those who care to see! Beyond capitalism lies more than just “it must be Communism,” and it’s worth exploring ideas that have served other human societies in order to conceive new systems for our future.\nFirst, however, it is prudent to come to adequate agreement as to what those first two words mean.\nThese days, it seems that both words – Capitalism and Communism – have come to mean something other than ways of organizing an economy and distributing the goods produced therein. Capitalism, then, relates to an economy based upon the accumulation and investment of particularly large piles of wealth to generate economic returns, a meaning utterly lost when the term has been watered down to something more akin to “freedom” or “warm, good, happy feelings of positivity.” Capitalism isn’t the same as simply having markets or engaging in trade. Although elements of capitalism are evident in, say, the forbidden medieval practice of usury (lending money to be repaid with interest), it really came into its own with such innovations as the chartered East India Company in the 18th century, which began the process of ravaging the subcontinent for private profit.\nLikewise, “communism” has come to mean “bad, evil things that inspire feelings of unhappiness” rather than “an economic system in which the major means of production are owned and controlled by the public,” with the aim of a classless, stateless society. In 20th century practice, this has often meant a state-controlled economy, though today’s anarchist-communists envision independent, egalitarian communities managing their own economic needs. Doubtless, private owners of capital would prefer that the idea of public collectivization of wealth be widely associated with grim, fearful feelings (similar to the way many economically disadvantaged poors feel about the word “capitalism” these days), but such emotional redefinition does little to advance the worthy goal of creating an economy that works for as many people as possible (and, importantly, doesn’t destroy the natural world on which our lives depend).\nKarl Marx, acknowledged father of revolutionary communist theory.

How else could an economy possibly be organized?\nPerhaps the oldest system is the gift economy. When humans lived together in small bands, often at least partially nomadic, one depended upon one’s tribe to live. Food was shared; there were social rules about how to parcel out a hunter’s kill. Those who accumulated too much or acted too greedily may have been mocked and humbled by their peers, ensuring that resources were spread widely. Gifts of food, tools, or other objects were regularly exchanged, and while everyone knew the score, not reciprocating similarly at some point was shameful. If you’ve ever attended a seed swap, a supper club, or even Christmas morning, you’ve taken part in a gift economy, where the best way to invest one’s excess is in one’s friends.\nLater came the palace economy. Greater control of a larger population enabled central elites to organize the production and distribution of goods. Land and materials may be provided, such as in the Inca Empire, where different villages were assigned different kinds of production. Finished goods would be collected at a central location, such as a palace or temple (since state and religious power were mingled, a condition some among us would prefer even now). Authorities would then redistribute the goods as they saw fit, whether around the kingdom to those that needed them, as trade goods with other polities, gifts to form alliances, financing a military, or what have you. A similar modern equivalent might be North Korea’s version of state communism, where the government decides what grains farmers are to grow, and redistributes whatever grain is produced back to the people “according to need” (and availability).\nYou likely heard about the next one in school: feudalism, the dominant economic system of medieval Europe, among other regions. Land (the most important means of production) was owned by the monarch, who lent control of it to the nobility in exchange for the promise of military support in war. Nobility lent smaller parcels to knights, who promised to fight. Knights then provided peasantry with land, in exchange for labor and a share of produce. The details and customs varied from place to place, of course, and the Church complicated it even more, but however hierarchal and oppressive, feudalism was a relatively efficient answer to the circumstances of the time. Nowadays, we don’t have to look far for the modern equivalent of a low-mobility landless underclass who serve their more wealthy ‘betters.’\nIndigenous tribes of the salmon-rich Pacific Northwest devised the potlatch economy. Any chief who wanted to remain in that position would do so by ordering a potlatch ceremony and inviting outsiders to attend. By commanding as much production of feast foods and gifts as that tribe could afford, and giving it away in abundance during the ceremony, the chief could earn prestige as the richest and most generous, the rightful big man. As in the gift economy, a mental tally was kept and reciprocity expected, with any shortfall resulting in the loss of political prestige. Organized as a way of allocating political power, it was also an effective way of distributing goods from those with more to those with less.\nDistributism is a lesser-known economic philosophy with its roots in Catholicism. Rather than the means of production being concentrated in the hands of the rich, or run by a government bureaucracy, the main goal of distributism is to spread the ownership of property and the means of production as widely as possible. This could mean a great many mom-and-pop shops, worker-owned co-ops, small diverse farms, and independent contractors. Sure, the lack of vast accumulations of capital would mean fewer giant corporations, but that price might be worth paying if it means that everyone had the means to sustain themselves.\nSocialism has become as emotionally loaded a term as capitalism or communism, but what is it really? Opinions vary, but in the democratic socialist, Nordic model held up by the likes of Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, there’s still a capitalist, market economy. Some of the most essential human needs, which aren’t always met by the market, are simply made available alongside and outside of it, funded by public taxation (that is, skimming a bit of the productivity off of a capitalist economy in order to make it serve more people). Major examples would be the British National Health Service, social security payments to the elderly, or state-owned banks that do not need to operate at a profit because their mission is more human-centric.\nAs you can see, beyond capitalism and communism lies an impressive array of other ways to live. In practice, no single economic system takes care of all needs perfectly. We live in such a mix, where we may work for a capitalist, receive food assistance benefits (SNAP) to subsidize an insufficient wage, trade baby clothes with a moms’ group, and take advantage of a community garden plot or CSA share.\nLooking around, however, it’s easy to see that the dominant form of American capitalism isn’t working for everyone. There are homeless people and people-less homes. Vast amounts of food are wasted, yet there are hungry people. We’re destroying the landbase and creating mountains of trash. Increasingly, people are impatient to find a better way, although their imaginations usually settle into two opposing and circularly-arguing camps. It’s a situation that could desperately use an injection of fresh ideas, because the system is failing. Sooner than later, we’ll have to figure out how to produce and distribute what people need, beyond capitalism.

Many of the loudest American voices seem attached to minds which can only think in binary terms: white/black, Democrat/Republican, Capitalist/Communist, freedom/slavery, good/evil. How much more there is, for those who care to see! Beyond capitalism lies more than just “it must be Communism,” and it’s worth exploring ideas that have served other human societies in order to conceive new systems for our future.\nFirst, however, it is prudent to come to adequate agreement as to what those first two words mean.\nThese days, it seems that both words – Capitalism and Communism – have come to mean something other than ways of organizing an economy and distributing the goods produced therein. Capitalism, then, relates to an economy based upon the accumulation and investment of particularly large piles of wealth to generate economic returns, a meaning utterly lost when the term has been watered down to something more akin to “freedom” or “warm, good, happy feelings of positivity.” Capitalism isn’t the same as simply having markets or engaging in trade. Although elements of capitalism are evident in, say, the forbidden medieval practice of usury (lending money to be repaid with interest), it really came into its own with such innovations as the chartered East India Company in the 18th century, which began the process of ravaging the subcontinent for private profit.\nLikewise, “communism” has come to mean “bad, evil things that inspire feelings of unhappiness” rather than “an economic system in which the major means of production are owned and controlled by the public,” with the aim of a classless, stateless society. In 20th century practice, this has often meant a state-controlled economy, though today’s anarchist-communists envision independent, egalitarian communities managing their own economic needs. Doubtless, private owners of capital would prefer that the idea of public collectivization of wealth be widely associated with grim, fearful feelings (similar to the way many economically disadvantaged poors feel about the word “capitalism” these days), but such emotional redefinition does little to advance the worthy goal of creating an economy that works for as many people as possible (and, importantly, doesn’t destroy the natural world on which our lives depend).\nKarl Marx, acknowledged father of revolutionary communist theory.

How else could an economy possibly be organized?\nPerhaps the oldest system is the gift economy. When humans lived together in small bands, often at least partially nomadic, one depended upon one’s tribe to live. Food was shared; there were social rules about how to parcel out a hunter’s kill. Those who accumulated too much or acted too greedily may have been mocked and humbled by their peers, ensuring that resources were spread widely. Gifts of food, tools, or other objects were regularly exchanged, and while everyone knew the score, not reciprocating similarly at some point was shameful. If you’ve ever attended a seed swap, a supper club, or even Christmas morning, you’ve taken part in a gift economy, where the best way to invest one’s excess is in one’s friends.\nLater came the palace economy. Greater control of a larger population enabled central elites to organize the production and distribution of goods. Land and materials may be provided, such as in the Inca Empire, where different villages were assigned different kinds of production. Finished goods would be collected at a central location, such as a palace or temple (since state and religious power were mingled, a condition some among us would prefer even now). Authorities would then redistribute the goods as they saw fit, whether around the kingdom to those that needed them, as trade goods with other polities, gifts to form alliances, financing a military, or what have you. A similar modern equivalent might be North Korea’s version of state communism, where the government decides what grains farmers are to grow, and redistributes whatever grain is produced back to the people “according to need” (and availability).\nYou likely heard about the next one in school: feudalism, the dominant economic system of medieval Europe, among other regions. Land (the most important means of production) was owned by the monarch, who lent control of it to the nobility in exchange for the promise of military support in war. Nobility lent smaller parcels to knights, who promised to fight. Knights then provided peasantry with land, in exchange for labor and a share of produce. The details and customs varied from place to place, of course, and the Church complicated it even more, but however hierarchal and oppressive, feudalism was a relatively efficient answer to the circumstances of the time. Nowadays, we don’t have to look far for the modern equivalent of a low-mobility landless underclass who serve their more wealthy ‘betters.’\nIndigenous tribes of the salmon-rich Pacific Northwest devised the potlatch economy. Any chief who wanted to remain in that position would do so by ordering a potlatch ceremony and inviting outsiders to attend. By commanding as much production of feast foods and gifts as that tribe could afford, and giving it away in abundance during the ceremony, the chief could earn prestige as the richest and most generous, the rightful big man. As in the gift economy, a mental tally was kept and reciprocity expected, with any shortfall resulting in the loss of political prestige. Organized as a way of allocating political power, it was also an effective way of distributing goods from those with more to those with less.\nDistributism is a lesser-known economic philosophy with its roots in Catholicism. Rather than the means of production being concentrated in the hands of the rich, or run by a government bureaucracy, the main goal of distributism is to spread the ownership of property and the means of production as widely as possible. This could mean a great many mom-and-pop shops, worker-owned co-ops, small diverse farms, and independent contractors. Sure, the lack of vast accumulations of capital would mean fewer giant corporations, but that price might be worth paying if it means that everyone had the means to sustain themselves.\nSocialism has become as emotionally loaded a term as capitalism or communism, but what is it really? Opinions vary, but in the democratic socialist, Nordic model held up by the likes of Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, there’s still a capitalist, market economy. Some of the most essential human needs, which aren’t always met by the market, are simply made available alongside and outside of it, funded by public taxation (that is, skimming a bit of the productivity off of a capitalist economy in order to make it serve more people). Major examples would be the British National Health Service, social security payments to the elderly, or state-owned banks that do not need to operate at a profit because their mission is more human-centric.\nAs you can see, beyond capitalism and communism lies an impressive array of other ways to live. In practice, no single economic system takes care of all needs perfectly. We live in such a mix, where we may work for a capitalist, receive food assistance benefits (SNAP) to subsidize an insufficient wage, trade baby clothes with a moms’ group, and take advantage of a community garden plot or CSA share.\nLooking around, however, it’s easy to see that the dominant form of American capitalism isn’t working for everyone. There are homeless people and people-less homes. Vast amounts of food are wasted, yet there are hungry people. We’re destroying the landbase and creating mountains of trash. Increasingly, people are impatient to find a better way, although their imaginations usually settle into two opposing and circularly-arguing camps. It’s a situation that could desperately use an injection of fresh ideas, because the system is failing. Sooner than later, we’ll have to figure out how to produce and distribute what people need, beyond capitalism.

Many of the loudest American voices seem attached to minds which can only think in binary terms: white/black, Democrat/Republican, Capitalist/Communist, freedom/slavery, good/evil. How much more there is, for those who care to see!

Although elements of capitalism are evident in, say, the forbidden medieval practice of usury (lending money to be repaid with interest), it really came into its own with such innovations as the chartered <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/0f1ec9da-c9a6-11e9-af46-b09e8bfe60c0\">East India Company</a> in the 18th century, which began the process of ravaging the subcontinent for private profit.</p>\n<p>Likewise, “communism” has come to mean “bad, evil things that inspire feelings of unhappiness” rather than “an economic system in which the major means of production are <a href=\"https://www.britannica.com/topic/communism\">owned and controlled by the public</a>,” with the aim of a classless, stateless society. In 20th century practice, this has often meant a state-controlled economy, though today’s anarchist-communists envision <a href=\"https://libcom.org/article/anarchist-communism-introduction\">independent, egalitarian communities</a> managing their own economic needs. Doubtless, private owners of capital would prefer that the idea of public collectivization of wealth be widely associated with grim, fearful feelings (similar to the way many economically disadvantaged poors feel about the word “capitalism” these days), but such emotional redefinition does little to advance the worthy goal of creating an economy that works for as many people as possible (and, importantly, doesn’t destroy the natural world on which our lives depend).</p>\n<a href=\"https://www.legalreader.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Karl_Marx_1875.jpg\"><img src=\"https://www.legalreader.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Karl_Marx_1875.jpg\" alt=\"Vintage photograph of a man with bushy, white hair and beard, seated, wearing formal clothes.\" width=\"300\" height=\"380\" /></a>Karl Marx, acknowledged father of revolutionary communist theory.

How else could an economy possibly be organized?</p>\n<p>Perhaps the oldest system is the <a href=\"https://maggieappleton.com/gift-economy\">gift economy</a>. When humans lived together in small bands, often at least partially nomadic, one depended upon one’s tribe to live. Food was shared; there were social rules about how to parcel out a hunter’s kill. Those who accumulated too much or acted too greedily may have been <a href=\"https://www.sapiens.org/culture/hunter-gatherer-inequality-namibia/\">mocked and humbled</a> by their peers, ensuring that resources were spread widely. Gifts of food, tools, or other objects were regularly exchanged, and while everyone knew the score, not reciprocating similarly at some point was shameful. If you’ve ever attended a seed swap, a supper club, or even Christmas morning, you’ve taken part in a gift economy, where the best way to invest one’s excess is in one’s friends.</p>\n<p>Later came the <a href=\"https://ecotalker.wordpress.com/2020/09/16/totw-palace-economy/\">palace economy</a>. Greater control of a larger population enabled central elites to organize the production and distribution of goods. Land and materials may be provided, such as in the Inca Empire, where different villages were assigned different kinds of production. Finished goods would be collected at a central location, such as a palace or <a href=\"https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/iraq/article/abs/origins-of-the-templeeconomy-as-seen-in-the-light-of-prehistoric-evidence/E6CED755CA475E624BFCD64BAB3B2212\">temple</a> (since state and religious power were mingled, a condition some among us would prefer even now). Authorities would then redistribute the goods as they saw fit, whether around the kingdom to those that needed them, as trade goods with other polities, gifts to form alliances, financing a military, or what have you. A similar modern equivalent might be <a href=\"https://archive.foodfirst.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/PB11-Famine-in-North-Korea-Christine-Ahn.pdf\">North Korea’s version of state communism</a>, where the government decides what grains farmers are to grow, and redistributes whatever grain is produced back to the people “according to need” (and availability).</p>\n<p>You likely heard about the next one in school: <a href=\"https://www.worldhistory.org/Feudalism/\">feudalism</a>, the dominant economic system of medieval Europe, among other regions. Land (the most important means of production) was owned by the monarch, who lent control of it to the nobility in exchange for the promise of military support in war. Nobility lent smaller parcels to knights, who promised to fight. Knights then provided peasantry with land, in exchange for labor and a share of produce. The details and customs varied from place to place, of course, and the Church complicated it even more, but however <a href=\"https://www.worldhistory.org/image/15424/the-feudal-society-in-medieval-europe/\">hierarchal</a> and oppressive, feudalism was a relatively efficient answer to the circumstances of the time. Nowadays, <a href=\"https://lareviewofbooks.org/article/neofeudalism-the-end-of-capitalism/\">we don’t have to look far</a> for the modern equivalent of a low-mobility landless underclass who serve their more wealthy ‘betters.’</p>\n<p>Indigenous tribes of the salmon-rich Pacific Northwest devised <a href=\"https://www.law.gmu.edu/assets/files/publications/working_papers/1605.pdf\">the potlatch economy</a>. Any chief who wanted to remain in that position would do so by ordering a potlatch ceremony and inviting outsiders to attend. By commanding as much production of feast foods and gifts as that tribe could afford, and giving it away in abundance during the ceremony, the chief could earn prestige as the richest and most generous, the rightful big man. As in the gift economy, a mental tally was kept and reciprocity expected, with any shortfall resulting in the loss of political prestige. Organized as a way of allocating political power, it was also an effective way of distributing goods from those with more to those with less.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://distributistreview.com/archive/an-introduction-to-distributism\">Distributism</a> is a lesser-known economic philosophy with its roots in Catholicism. Rather than the means of production being concentrated in the hands of the rich, or run by a government bureaucracy, the main goal of distributism is to <a href=\"https://modjourn.org/essay/distributism/\">spread the ownership of property and the means of production as widely as possible</a>. This could <a href=\"http://static1.squarespace.com/static/5e486131a9ec956ab43c1f8e/5e4862202773074a5cd60bb2/5e4862232773074a5cd60de4/1581802019229/wallst.pdf?format=original\">mean</a> a great many mom-and-pop shops, worker-owned co-ops, small diverse farms, and independent contractors. Sure, the lack of vast accumulations of capital would mean fewer giant corporations, but that price might be worth paying if it means that everyone had the means to sustain themselves.</p>\n<p>Socialism has become as emotionally loaded a term as capitalism or communism, but what is it really? Opinions vary, but in the democratic socialist, Nordic model held up by the likes of Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, there’s still a capitalist, market economy. Some of the most essential human needs, which aren’t always met by the market, are simply <a href=\"https://jacobin.com/2020/05/capitalism-socialism-cooperatives-market-nhs-democracy\">made available alongside and outside</a> of it, funded by public taxation (that is, <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/2016/9/1/12732168/economic-freedom-score-america-welfare-state\">skimming a bit of the productivity off of a capitalist economy</a> in order to make it serve more people). Major examples would be the British National Health Service, social security payments to the elderly, or state-owned banks that do not need to operate at a profit because their mission is more human-centric.</p>\n<p>As you can see, beyond capitalism and communism lies an impressive array of other ways to live. In practice, no single economic system takes care of all needs perfectly. We live in such a mix, where we may work for a capitalist, receive food assistance benefits (SNAP) to subsidize an insufficient wage, trade baby clothes with a moms’ group, and take advantage of a community garden plot or CSA share.</p>\n<p>Looking around, however, it’s easy to see that the dominant form of American capitalism isn’t working for everyone. There are homeless people and people-less homes. Vast amounts of food are wasted, yet there are hungry people. We’re destroying the landbase and creating mountains of trash. Increasingly, people are impatient to find a better way, although their imaginations usually <a href=\"https://news.mikecallicrate.com/gods-and-radicals-neither-capitalism-nor-socialism-a-third-alternative/\">settle into two</a> opposing and circularly-arguing camps. It’s a situation that could desperately use an injection of fresh ideas, because the system is failing. Sooner than later, we’ll have to figure out how to produce and distribute what people need, beyond capitalism. Let’s start now.</p>\n<p><strong>Related:</strong> <a href=\"https://www.legalreader.com/distributism-an-oldnew-economic-answer/\">Distributism: An Old/New Economic Answer</a></p>\n<h2><span>Sources:</span></h2>\n<h6><span><a href=\"http://www.historyworld.net/wrldhis/plaintexthistories.asp?historyid=aa49\">History of Capitalism</a></span></h6>\n<h6><span><a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/0f1ec9da-c9a6-11e9-af46-b09e8bfe60c0\">Lessons for capitalism from the East India Company</a></span></h6>\n<h6><span><a href=\"https://www.britannica.com/topic/communism\">Communism</a></span></h6>\n<h6><span><a href=\"https://libcom.org/article/anarchist-communism-introduction\">Anarchist communism – an introduction</a></span></h6>\n<h6><span><a href=\"https://maggieappleton.com/gift-economy\">The Gift Economy</a></span></h6>\n<h6><span><a href=\"https://www.sapiens.org/culture/hunter-gatherer-inequality-namibia/\">Why Envy Might Be Good for Us</a></span></h6>\n<h6><span><a href=\"https://ecotalker.wordpress.com/2020/09/16/totw-palace-economy/\">TOTW: Palace Economy</a></span></h6>\n<h6><span><a href=\"https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/iraq/article/abs/origins-of-the-templeeconomy-as-seen-in-the-light-of-prehistoric-evidence/E6CED755CA475E624BFCD64BAB3B2212\">The Origins of the “Temple-Economy” as seen in the Light of Prehistoric Evidence</a></span></h6>\n<h6><span><a href=\"https://archive.foodfirst.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/PB11-Famine-in-North-Korea-Christine-Ahn.pdf\">Famine and the Future of Food Security in North Korea</a> [PDF]</span></h6>\n<h6><span><a href=\"https://www.worldhistory.org/Feudalism/\">Feudalism</a></span></h6>\n<h6><span><a href=\"https://www.worldhistory.org/image/15424/the-feudal-society-in-medieval-europe/\">The Feudal Society in Medieval Europe</a></span></h6>\n<h6><span><a href=\"https://lareviewofbooks.org/article/neofeudalism-the-end-of-capitalism/\">Neofeudalism: The End of Capitalism?</a></span></h6>\n<h6><span><a href=\"https://www.law.gmu.edu/assets/files/publications/working_papers/1605.pdf\">The Potlatch as Fractional Reserve Banking</a> [PDF]</span></h6>\n<h6><span><a href=\"https://distributistreview.com/archive/an-introduction-to-distributism\">An Introduction to Distributism</a></span></h6>\n<h6><span><a href=\"https://modjourn.org/essay/distributism/\">Distributism</a></span></h6>\n<h6><span><a href=\"https://news.mikecallicrate.com/gods-and-radicals-neither-capitalism-nor-socialism-a-third-alternative/\">Neither Capitalism nor Socialism: A Third Alternative</a></span></h6>\n<h6><span><a href=\"https://jacobin.com/2020/05/capitalism-socialism-cooperatives-market-nhs-democracy\">Capitalism Isn’t Working.

Doubtless, private owners of capital would prefer that the idea of public collectivization of wealth be widely associated with grim, fearful feelings (similar to the way many economically disadvantaged poors feel about the word “capitalism” these days), but such emotional redefinition does little to advance the worthy goal of creating an economy that works for as many people as possible (and, importantly, doesn’t destroy the natural world on which our lives depend).\nKarl Marx, acknowledged father of revolutionary communist theory.

How else could an economy possibly be organized?\nPerhaps the oldest system is the gift economy. When humans lived together in small bands, often at least partially nomadic, one depended upon one’s tribe to live. Food was shared; there were social rules about how to parcel out a hunter’s kill. Those who accumulated too much or acted too greedily may have been mocked and humbled by their peers, ensuring that resources were spread widely. Gifts of food, tools, or other objects were regularly exchanged, and while everyone knew the score, not reciprocating similarly at some point was shameful. If you’ve ever attended a seed swap, a supper club, or even Christmas morning, you’ve taken part in a gift economy, where the best way to invest one’s excess is in one’s friends.\nLater came the palace economy. Greater control of a larger population enabled central elites to organize the production and distribution of goods. Land and materials may be provided, such as in the Inca Empire, where different villages were assigned different kinds of production. Finished goods would be collected at a central location, such as a palace or temple (since state and religious power were mingled, a condition some among us would prefer even now). Authorities would then redistribute the goods as they saw fit, whether around the kingdom to those that needed them, as trade goods with other polities, gifts to form alliances, financing a military, or what have you. A similar modern equivalent might be North Korea’s version of state communism, where the government decides what grains farmers are to grow, and redistributes whatever grain is produced back to the people “according to need” (and availability).\nYou likely heard about the next one in school: feudalism, the dominant economic system of medieval Europe, among other regions. Land (the most important means of production) was owned by the monarch, who lent control of it to the nobility in exchange for the promise of military support in war. Nobility lent smaller parcels to knights, who promised to fight. Knights then provided peasantry with land, in exchange for labor and a share of produce. The details and customs varied from place to place, of course, and the Church complicated it even more, but however hierarchal and oppressive, feudalism was a relatively efficient answer to the circumstances of the time. Nowadays, we don’t have to look far for the modern equivalent of a low-mobility landless underclass who serve their more wealthy ‘betters.’\nIndigenous tribes of the salmon-rich Pacific Northwest devised the potlatch economy. Any chief who wanted to remain in that position would do so by ordering a potlatch ceremony and inviting outsiders to attend. By commanding as much production of feast foods and gifts as that tribe could afford, and giving it away in abundance during the ceremony, the chief could earn prestige as the richest and most generous, the rightful big man. As in the gift economy, a mental tally was kept and reciprocity expected, with any shortfall resulting in the loss of political prestige. Organized as a way of allocating political power, it was also an effective way of distributing goods from those with more to those with less.\nDistributism is a lesser-known economic philosophy with its roots in Catholicism. Rather than the means of production being concentrated in the hands of the rich, or run by a government bureaucracy, the main goal of distributism is to spread the ownership of property and the means of production as widely as possible. This could mean a great many mom-and-pop shops, worker-owned co-ops, small diverse farms, and independent contractors. Sure, the lack of vast accumulations of capital would mean fewer giant corporations, but that price might be worth paying if it means that everyone had the means to sustain themselves.\nSocialism has become as emotionally loaded a term as capitalism or communism, but what is it really? Opinions vary, but in the democratic socialist, Nordic model held up by the likes of Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, there’s still a capitalist, market economy. Some of the most essential human needs, which aren’t always met by the market, are simply made available alongside and outside of it, funded by public taxation (that is, skimming a bit of the productivity off of a capitalist economy in order to make it serve more people). Major examples would be the British National Health Service, social security payments to the elderly, or state-owned banks that do not need to operate at a profit because their mission is more human-centric.\nAs you can see, beyond capitalism and communism lies an impressive array of other ways to live. In practice, no single economic system takes care of all needs perfectly. We live in such a mix, where we may work for a capitalist, receive food assistance benefits (SNAP) to subsidize an insufficient wage, trade baby clothes with a moms’ group, and take advantage of a community garden plot or CSA share.\nLooking around, however, it’s easy to see that the dominant form of American capitalism isn’t working for everyone. There are homeless people and people-less homes. Vast amounts of food are wasted, yet there are hungry people. We’re destroying the landbase and creating mountains of trash. Increasingly, people are impatient to find a better way, although their imaginations usually settle into two opposing and circularly-arguing camps. It’s a situation that could desperately use an injection of fresh ideas, because the system is failing. Sooner than later, we’ll have to figure out how to produce and distribute what people need, beyond capitalism.

Many of the loudest American voices seem attached to minds which can only think in binary terms: white/black, Democrat/Republican, Capitalist/Communist, freedom/slavery, good/evil. How much more there is, for those who care to see! Beyond capitalism lies more than just “it must be Communism,” and it’s worth exploring ideas that have served other human societies in order to conceive new systems for our future.</p>\n<p>First, however, it is prudent to come to adequate agreement as to what those first two words mean.</p>\n<p>These days, it seems that both words – Capitalism and Communism – have come to mean something other than ways of organizing an economy and distributing the goods produced therein. <a href=\"http://www.historyworld.net/wrldhis/plaintexthistories.asp?historyid=aa49\">Capitalism</a>, then, relates to an economy based upon the accumulation and investment of particularly large piles of wealth to generate economic returns, a meaning utterly lost when the term has been watered down to something more akin to “freedom” or “warm, good, happy feelings of positivity.” Capitalism <a href=\"https://news.mikecallicrate.com/gods-and-radicals-neither-capitalism-nor-socialism-a-third-alternative/\">isn’t the same</a> as simply having markets or engaging in trade. Although elements of capitalism are evident in, say, the forbidden medieval practice of usury (lending money to be repaid with interest), it really came into its own with such innovations as the chartered <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/0f1ec9da-c9a6-11e9-af46-b09e8bfe60c0\">East India Company</a> in the 18th century, which began the process of ravaging the subcontinent for private profit.</p>\n<p>Likewise, “communism” has come to mean “bad, evil things that inspire feelings of unhappiness” rather than “an economic system in which the major means of production are <a href=\"https://www.britannica.com/topic/communism\">owned and controlled by the public</a>,” with the aim of a classless, stateless society.

Many of the loudest American voices seem attached to minds which can only think in binary terms: white/black, Democrat/Republican, Capitalist/Communist, freedom/slavery, good/evil. How much more there is, for those who care to see! Beyond capitalism lies more than just “it must be Communism,” and it’s worth exploring ideas that have served other human societies in order to conceive new systems for our future.\nFirst, however, it is prudent to come to adequate agreement as to what those first two words mean.\nThese days, it seems that both words – Capitalism and Communism – have come to mean something other than ways of organizing an economy and distributing the goods produced therein. Capitalism, then, relates to an economy based upon the accumulation and investment of particularly large piles of wealth to generate economic returns, a meaning utterly lost when the term has been watered down to something more akin to “freedom” or “warm, good, happy feelings of positivity.” Capitalism isn’t the same as simply having markets or engaging in trade. Although elements of capitalism are evident in, say, the forbidden medieval practice of usury (lending money to be repaid with interest), it really came into its own with such innovations as the chartered East India Company in the 18th century, which began the process of ravaging the subcontinent for private profit.\nLikewise, “communism” has come to mean “bad, evil things that inspire feelings of unhappiness” rather than “an economic system in which the major means of production are owned and controlled by the public,” with the aim of a classless, stateless society. In 20th century practice, this has often meant a state-controlled economy, though today’s anarchist-communists envision independent, egalitarian communities managing their own economic needs. Doubtless, private owners of capital would prefer that the idea of public collectivization of wealth be widely associated with grim, fearful feelings (similar to the way many economically disadvantaged poors feel about the word “capitalism” these days), but such emotional redefinition does little to advance the worthy goal of creating an economy that works for as many people as possible (and, importantly, doesn’t destroy the natural world on which our lives depend).\nKarl Marx, acknowledged father of revolutionary communist theory.

How else could an economy possibly be organized?\nPerhaps the oldest system is the gift economy. When humans lived together in small bands, often at least partially nomadic, one depended upon one’s tribe to live. Food was shared; there were social rules about how to parcel out a hunter’s kill. Those who accumulated too much or acted too greedily may have been mocked and humbled by their peers, ensuring that resources were spread widely. Gifts of food, tools, or other objects were regularly exchanged, and while everyone knew the score, not reciprocating similarly at some point was shameful. If you’ve ever attended a seed swap, a supper club, or even Christmas morning, you’ve taken part in a gift economy, where the best way to invest one’s excess is in one’s friends.\nLater came the palace economy. Greater control of a larger population enabled central elites to organize the production and distribution of goods. Land and materials may be provided, such as in the Inca Empire, where different villages were assigned different kinds of production. Finished goods would be collected at a central location, such as a palace or temple (since state and religious power were mingled, a condition some among us would prefer even now). Authorities would then redistribute the goods as they saw fit, whether around the kingdom to those that needed them, as trade goods with other polities, gifts to form alliances, financing a military, or what have you. A similar modern equivalent might be North Korea’s version of state communism, where the government decides what grains farmers are to grow, and redistributes whatever grain is produced back to the people “according to need” (and availability).\nYou likely heard about the next one in school: feudalism, the dominant economic system of medieval Europe, among other regions. Land (the most important means of production) was owned by the monarch, who lent control of it to the nobility in exchange for the promise of military support in war. Nobility lent smaller parcels to knights, who promised to fight. Knights then provided peasantry with land, in exchange for labor and a share of produce. The details and customs varied from place to place, of course, and the Church complicated it even more, but however hierarchal and oppressive, feudalism was a relatively efficient answer to the circumstances of the time. Nowadays, we don’t have to look far for the modern equivalent of a low-mobility landless underclass who serve their more wealthy ‘betters.’\nIndigenous tribes of the salmon-rich Pacific Northwest devised the potlatch economy. Any chief who wanted to remain in that position would do so by ordering a potlatch ceremony and inviting outsiders to attend. By commanding as much production of feast foods and gifts as that tribe could afford, and giving it away in abundance during the ceremony, the chief could earn prestige as the richest and most generous, the rightful big man. As in the gift economy, a mental tally was kept and reciprocity expected, with any shortfall resulting in the loss of political prestige. Organized as a way of allocating political power, it was also an effective way of distributing goods from those with more to those with less.\nDistributism is a lesser-known economic philosophy with its roots in Catholicism. Rather than the means of production being concentrated in the hands of the rich, or run by a government bureaucracy, the main goal of distributism is to spread the ownership of property and the means of production as widely as possible. This could mean a great many mom-and-pop shops, worker-owned co-ops, small diverse farms, and independent contractors. Sure, the lack of vast accumulations of capital would mean fewer giant corporations, but that price might be worth paying if it means that everyone had the means to sustain themselves.\nSocialism has become as emotionally loaded a term as capitalism or communism, but what is it really? Opinions vary, but in the democratic socialist, Nordic model held up by the likes of Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, there’s still a capitalist, market economy. Some of the most essential human needs, which aren’t always met by the market, are simply made available alongside and outside of it, funded by public taxation (that is, skimming a bit of the productivity off of a capitalist economy in order to make it serve more people). Major examples would be the British National Health Service, social security payments to the elderly, or state-owned banks that do not need to operate at a profit because their mission is more human-centric.\nAs you can see, beyond capitalism and communism lies an impressive array of other ways to live. In practice, no single economic system takes care of all needs perfectly. We live in such a mix, where we may work for a capitalist, receive food assistance benefits (SNAP) to subsidize an insufficient wage, trade baby clothes with a moms’ group, and take advantage of a community garden plot or CSA share.\nLooking around, however, it’s easy to see that the dominant form of American capitalism isn’t working for everyone. There are homeless people and people-less homes. Vast amounts of food are wasted, yet there are hungry people. We’re destroying the landbase and creating mountains of trash. Increasingly, people are impatient to find a better way, although their imaginations usually settle into two opposing and circularly-arguing camps. It’s a situation that could desperately use an injection of fresh ideas, because the system is failing. Sooner than later, we’ll have to figure out how to produce and distribute what people need, beyond capitalism.

Past capitalism lies extra than simply “it should be Communism,” and it’s price exploring concepts which have served different human societies as a way to conceive new programs for our future.</p>\n<p>First, nonetheless, it’s prudent to return to sufficient settlement as to what these first two phrases imply.</p>\n<p>Today, it appears that evidently each phrases – Capitalism and Communism – have come to imply one thing aside from methods of organizing an economic system and distributing the products produced therein. <a href=\"http://www.historyworld.net/wrldhis/plaintexthistories.asp?historyid=aa49\">Capitalism</a>, then, pertains to an economic system primarily based upon the buildup and funding of significantly giant piles of wealth to generate financial returns, a that means completely misplaced when the time period has been watered right down to one thing extra akin to “freedom” or “heat, good, completely satisfied emotions of positivity.” Capitalism <a href=\"https://news.mikecallicrate.com/gods-and-radicals-neither-capitalism-nor-socialism-a-third-alternative/\">isn’t the same</a> as merely having markets or participating in commerce. Though parts of capitalism are evident in, say, the forbidden medieval apply of usury (lending cash to be repaid with curiosity), it actually got here into its personal with such improvements because the chartered <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/0f1ec9da-c9a6-11e9-af46-b09e8bfe60c0\">East India Company</a> within the 18th century, which started the method of ravaging the subcontinent for personal revenue.</p>\n<p>Likewise, “communism” has come to imply “dangerous, evil issues that encourage emotions of unhappiness” slightly than “an financial system through which the key technique of manufacturing are <a href=\"https://www.britannica.com/topic/communism\">owned and controlled by the public</a>,” with the intention of a classless, stateless society. In twentieth century apply, this has typically meant a state-controlled economic system, although as we speak’s anarchist-communists envision <a href=\"https://libcom.org/article/anarchist-communism-introduction\">independent, egalitarian communities</a> managing their very own financial wants. Probably, personal homeowners of capital would favor that the concept of public collectivization of wealth be extensively related to grim, fearful emotions (much like the way in which many economically deprived poors really feel concerning the phrase “capitalism” lately), however such emotional redefinition does little to advance the worthy aim of making an economic system that works for as many individuals as doable (and, importantly, doesn’t destroy the pure world on which our lives rely).</p>\n<a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.legalreader.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Karl_Marx_1875.jpg?ssl=1\"><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.legalreader.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Karl_Marx_1875.jpg?resize=300%2C380&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"Vintage photograph of a man with bushy, white hair and beard, seated, wearing formal clothes.\" width=\"300\" height=\"380\" /></a>Karl Marx, acknowledged father of revolutionary communist principle.

How else might an economic system probably be organized?</p>\n<p>Maybe the oldest system is the <a href=\"https://maggieappleton.com/gift-economy\">gift economy</a>. When people lived collectively in small bands, typically at the least partially nomadic, one depended upon one’s tribe to stay. Meals was shared; there have been social guidelines about the best way to parcel out a hunter’s kill. Those that accrued an excessive amount of or acted too greedily might have been <a href=\"https://www.sapiens.org/culture/hunter-gatherer-inequality-namibia/\">mocked and humbled</a> by their friends, guaranteeing that assets had been unfold extensively. Items of meals, instruments, or different objects had been repeatedly exchanged, and whereas everybody knew the rating, not reciprocating equally sooner or later was shameful. In case you’ve ever attended a seed swap, a supper membership, and even Christmas morning, you’ve taken half in a present economic system, the place one of the best ways to speculate one’s extra is in a single’s associates.</p>\n<p>Later got here the <a href=\"https://ecotalker.wordpress.com/2020/09/16/totw-palace-economy/\">palace economy</a>. Better management of a bigger inhabitants enabled central elites to arrange the manufacturing and distribution of products. Land and supplies could also be supplied, resembling within the Inca Empire, the place totally different villages had been assigned totally different sorts of manufacturing. Completed items could be collected at a central location, resembling a palace or <a href=\"https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/iraq/article/abs/origins-of-the-templeeconomy-as-seen-in-the-light-of-prehistoric-evidence/E6CED755CA475E624BFCD64BAB3B2212\">temple</a> (since state and spiritual energy had been mingled, a situation some amongst us would favor even now). Authorities would then redistribute the products as they noticed match, whether or not across the kingdom to people who wanted them, as commerce items with different polities, presents to kind alliances, financing a army, or what have you ever. An identical trendy equal is likely to be <a href=\"https://archive.foodfirst.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/PB11-Famine-in-North-Korea-Christine-Ahn.pdf\">North Korea’s version of state communism</a>, the place the federal government decides what grains farmers are to develop, and redistributes no matter grain is produced again to the individuals “in keeping with want” (and availability).</p>\n<p>You probably heard concerning the subsequent one in class: <a href=\"https://www.worldhistory.org/Feudalism/\">feudalism</a>, the dominant financial system of medieval Europe, amongst different areas. Land (crucial technique of manufacturing) was owned by the monarch, who lent management of it to the the Aristocracy in trade for the promise of army assist in battle. The Aristocracy lent smaller parcels to knights, who promised to combat. Knights then supplied peasantry with land, in trade for labor and a share of produce. The main points and customs diversified from place to position, after all, and the Church sophisticated it much more, however nonetheless <a href=\"https://www.worldhistory.org/image/15424/the-feudal-society-in-medieval-europe/\">hierarchal</a> and oppressive, feudalism was a comparatively environment friendly reply to the circumstances of the time. These days, <a href=\"https://lareviewofbooks.org/article/neofeudalism-the-end-of-capitalism/\">we don’t have to look far</a> for the trendy equal of a low-mobility landless underclass who serve their extra rich ‘betters.’</p>\n<p>Indigenous tribes of the salmon-rich Pacific Northwest devised <a href=\"https://www.law.gmu.edu/assets/files/publications/working_papers/1605.pdf\">the potlatch economy</a>. Any chief who needed to stay in that place would accomplish that by ordering a potlatch ceremony and alluring outsiders to attend. By commanding as a lot manufacturing of feast meals and presents as that tribe might afford, and giving it away in abundance through the ceremony, the chief might earn status because the richest and most beneficiant, the rightful large man. As within the present economic system, a psychological tally was saved and reciprocity anticipated, with any shortfall ensuing within the lack of political status. Organized as a manner of allocating political energy, it was additionally an efficient manner of distributing items from these with extra to these with much less.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://distributistreview.com/archive/an-introduction-to-distributism\">Distributism</a> is a lesser-known financial philosophy with its roots in Catholicism. Slightly than the technique of manufacturing being concentrated within the fingers of the wealthy, or run by a authorities forms, the primary aim of distributism is to <a href=\"https://modjourn.org/essay/distributism/\">spread the ownership of property and the means of production as widely as possible</a>. This might <a href=\"http://static1.squarespace.com/static/5e486131a9ec956ab43c1f8e/5e4862202773074a5cd60bb2/5e4862232773074a5cd60de4/1581802019229/wallst.pdf?format=original\">mean</a> an awesome many mom-and-pop outlets, worker-owned co-ops, small various farms, and unbiased contractors. Positive, the dearth of huge accumulations of capital would imply fewer big companies, however that worth is likely to be price paying if it signifies that everybody had the means to maintain themselves.</p>\n<p>Socialism has grow to be as emotionally loaded a time period as capitalism or communism, however what’s it actually? Opinions differ, however within the democratic socialist, Nordic mannequin held up by the likes of Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, there’s nonetheless a capitalist, market economic system. A few of the most important human wants, which aren’t all the time met by the market, are merely <a href=\"https://jacobin.com/2020/05/capitalism-socialism-cooperatives-market-nhs-democracy\">made available alongside and outside</a> of it, funded by public taxation (that’s, <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/2016/9/1/12732168/economic-freedom-score-america-welfare-state\">skimming a bit of the productivity off of a capitalist economy</a> as a way to make it serve extra individuals). Main examples could be the British Nationwide Well being Service, social safety funds to the aged, or state-owned banks that don’t must function at a revenue as a result of their mission is extra human-centric.</p>\n<p>As you may see, past capitalism and communism lies a formidable array of different methods to stay. In apply, no single financial system takes care of all wants completely. We stay in such a combination, the place we may match for a capitalist, obtain meals help advantages (SNAP) to subsidize an inadequate wage, commerce child garments with a mothers’ group, and make the most of a group backyard plot or CSA share.</p>\n<p>Wanting round, nonetheless, it’s simple to see that the dominant type of American capitalism isn’t working for everybody. There are homeless individuals and people-less houses. Huge quantities of meals are wasted, but there are hungry individuals. We’re destroying the landbase and creating mountains of trash. More and more, individuals are impatient to discover a higher manner, though their imaginations often <a href=\"https://news.mikecallicrate.com/gods-and-radicals-neither-capitalism-nor-socialism-a-third-alternative/\">settle into two</a> opposing and circularly-arguing camps. It’s a scenario that might desperately use an injection of recent concepts, as a result of the system is failing. Earlier than later, we’ll have to determine the best way to produce and distribute what individuals want, past capitalism. Let’s begin now.</p>\n<p><strong>Associated:</strong> <a href=\"https://www.legalreader.com/distributism-an-oldnew-economic-answer/\">Distributism: An Old/New Economic Answer</a></p>\n<h2><span>Sources:</span></h2>\n<h6><span><a href=\"http://www.historyworld.net/wrldhis/plaintexthistories.asp?historyid=aa49\">History of Capitalism</a></span></h6>\n<h6><span><a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/0f1ec9da-c9a6-11e9-af46-b09e8bfe60c0\">Lessons for capitalism from the East India Company</a></span></h6>\n<h6><span><a href=\"https://www.britannica.com/topic/communism\">Communism</a></span></h6>\n<h6><span><a href=\"https://libcom.org/article/anarchist-communism-introduction\">Anarchist communism – an introduction</a></span></h6>\n<h6><span><a href=\"https://maggieappleton.com/gift-economy\">The Gift Economy</a></span></h6>\n<h6><span><a href=\"https://www.sapiens.org/culture/hunter-gatherer-inequality-namibia/\">Why Envy Might Be Good for Us</a></span></h6>\n<h6><span><a href=\"https://ecotalker.wordpress.com/2020/09/16/totw-palace-economy/\">TOTW: Palace Economy</a></span></h6>\n<h6><span><a href=\"https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/iraq/article/abs/origins-of-the-templeeconomy-as-seen-in-the-light-of-prehistoric-evidence/E6CED755CA475E624BFCD64BAB3B2212\">The Origins of the “Temple-Economy” as seen in the Light of Prehistoric Evidence</a></span></h6>\n<h6><span><a href=\"https://archive.foodfirst.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/PB11-Famine-in-North-Korea-Christine-Ahn.pdf\">Famine and the Future of Food Security in North Korea</a> [PDF]</span></h6>\n<h6><span><a href=\"https://www.worldhistory.org/Feudalism/\">Feudalism</a></span></h6>\n<h6><span><a href=\"https://www.worldhistory.org/image/15424/the-feudal-society-in-medieval-europe/\">The Feudal Society in Medieval Europe</a></span></h6>\n<h6><span><a href=\"https://lareviewofbooks.org/article/neofeudalism-the-end-of-capitalism/\">Neofeudalism: The End of Capitalism?</a></span></h6>\n<h6><span><a href=\"https://www.law.gmu.edu/assets/files/publications/working_papers/1605.pdf\">The Potlatch as Fractional Reserve Banking</a> [PDF]</span></h6>\n<h6><span><a href=\"https://distributistreview.com/archive/an-introduction-to-distributism\">An Introduction to Distributism</a></span></h6>\n<h6><span><a href=\"https://modjourn.org/essay/distributism/\">Distributism</a></span></h6>\n<h6><span><a href=\"https://news.mikecallicrate.com/gods-and-radicals-neither-capitalism-nor-socialism-a-third-alternative/\">Neither Capitalism nor Socialism: A Third Alternative</a></span></h6>\n<h6><span><a href=\"https://jacobin.com/2020/05/capitalism-socialism-cooperatives-market-nhs-democracy\">Capitalism Isn’t Working.

Capitalism, then, pertains to an economic system primarily based upon the buildup and funding of significantly giant piles of wealth to generate financial returns, a that means completely misplaced when the time period has been watered right down to one thing extra akin to “freedom” or “heat, good, completely satisfied emotions of positivity.” Capitalism isn’t the same as merely having markets or participating in commerce. Though parts of capitalism are evident in, say, the forbidden medieval apply of usury (lending cash to be repaid with curiosity), it actually got here into its personal with such improvements because the chartered East India Company within the 18th century, which started the method of ravaging the subcontinent for personal revenue.\nLikewise, “communism” has come to imply “dangerous, evil issues that encourage emotions of unhappiness” slightly than “an financial system through which the key technique of manufacturing are owned and controlled by the public,” with the intention of a classless, stateless society. In twentieth century apply, this has typically meant a state-controlled economic system, although as we speak’s anarchist-communists envision independent, egalitarian communities managing their very own financial wants. Probably, personal homeowners of capital would favor that the concept of public collectivization of wealth be extensively related to grim, fearful emotions (much like the way in which many economically deprived poors really feel concerning the phrase “capitalism” lately), however such emotional redefinition does little to advance the worthy aim of making an economic system that works for as many individuals as doable (and, importantly, doesn’t destroy the pure world on which our lives rely).\nKarl Marx, acknowledged father of revolutionary communist principle.

How else might an economic system probably be organized?\nMaybe the oldest system is the gift economy. When people lived collectively in small bands, typically at the least partially nomadic, one depended upon one’s tribe to stay. Meals was shared; there have been social guidelines about the best way to parcel out a hunter’s kill. Those that accrued an excessive amount of or acted too greedily might have been mocked and humbled by their friends, guaranteeing that assets had been unfold extensively. Items of meals, instruments, or different objects had been repeatedly exchanged, and whereas everybody knew the rating, not reciprocating equally sooner or later was shameful. In case you’ve ever attended a seed swap, a supper membership, and even Christmas morning, you’ve taken half in a present economic system, the place one of the best ways to speculate one’s extra is in a single’s associates.\nLater got here the palace economy. Better management of a bigger inhabitants enabled central elites to arrange the manufacturing and distribution of products. Land and supplies could also be supplied, resembling within the Inca Empire, the place totally different villages had been assigned totally different sorts of manufacturing. Completed items could be collected at a central location, resembling a palace or temple (since state and spiritual energy had been mingled, a situation some amongst us would favor even now). Authorities would then redistribute the products as they noticed match, whether or not across the kingdom to people who wanted them, as commerce items with different polities, presents to kind alliances, financing a army, or what have you ever. An identical trendy equal is likely to be North Korea’s version of state communism, the place the federal government decides what grains farmers are to develop, and redistributes no matter grain is produced again to the individuals “in keeping with want” (and availability).\nYou probably heard concerning the subsequent one in class: feudalism, the dominant financial system of medieval Europe, amongst different areas. Land (crucial technique of manufacturing) was owned by the monarch, who lent management of it to the the Aristocracy in trade for the promise of army assist in battle. The Aristocracy lent smaller parcels to knights, who promised to combat. Knights then supplied peasantry with land, in trade for labor and a share of produce. The main points and customs diversified from place to position, after all, and the Church sophisticated it much more, however nonetheless hierarchal and oppressive, feudalism was a comparatively environment friendly reply to the circumstances of the time. These days, we don’t have to look far for the trendy equal of a low-mobility landless underclass who serve their extra rich ‘betters.’\nIndigenous tribes of the salmon-rich Pacific Northwest devised the potlatch economy. Any chief who needed to stay in that place would accomplish that by ordering a potlatch ceremony and alluring outsiders to attend. By commanding as a lot manufacturing of feast meals and presents as that tribe might afford, and giving it away in abundance through the ceremony, the chief might earn status because the richest and most beneficiant, the rightful large man. As within the present economic system, a psychological tally was saved and reciprocity anticipated, with any shortfall ensuing within the lack of political status. Organized as a manner of allocating political energy, it was additionally an efficient manner of distributing items from these with extra to these with much less.\nDistributism is a lesser-known financial philosophy with its roots in Catholicism. Slightly than the technique of manufacturing being concentrated within the fingers of the wealthy, or run by a authorities forms, the primary aim of distributism is to spread the ownership of property and the means of production as widely as possible. This might mean an awesome many mom-and-pop outlets, worker-owned co-ops, small various farms, and unbiased contractors. Positive, the dearth of huge accumulations of capital would imply fewer big companies, however that worth is likely to be price paying if it signifies that everybody had the means to maintain themselves.\nSocialism has grow to be as emotionally loaded a time period as capitalism or communism, however what’s it actually? Opinions differ, however within the democratic socialist, Nordic mannequin held up by the likes of Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, there’s nonetheless a capitalist, market economic system. A few of the most important human wants, which aren’t all the time met by the market, are merely made available alongside and outside of it, funded by public taxation (that’s, skimming a bit of the productivity off of a capitalist economy as a way to make it serve extra individuals). Main examples could be the British Nationwide Well being Service, social safety funds to the aged, or state-owned banks that don’t must function at a revenue as a result of their mission is extra human-centric.\nAs you may see, past capitalism and communism lies a formidable array of different methods to stay. In apply, no single financial system takes care of all wants completely. We stay in such a combination, the place we may match for a capitalist, obtain meals help advantages (SNAP) to subsidize an inadequate wage, commerce child garments with a mothers’ group, and make the most of a group backyard plot or CSA share.\nWanting round, nonetheless, it’s simple to see that the dominant type of American capitalism isn’t working for everybody. There are homeless individuals and people-less houses. Huge quantities of meals are wasted, but there are hungry individuals. We’re destroying the landbase and creating mountains of trash. More and more, individuals are impatient to discover a higher manner, though their imaginations often settle into two opposing and circularly-arguing camps. It’s a scenario that might desperately use an injection of recent concepts, as a result of the system is failing. Earlier than later, we’ll have to determine the best way to produce and distribute what individuals want, past capitalism.

Many of the loudest American voices seem attached to minds which can only think in binary terms: white/black, Democrat/Republican, Capitalist/Communist, freedom/slavery, good/evil. How much more there is, for those who care to see! Beyond capitalism lies more than just “it must be Communism,” and it’s worth exploring ideas that have served other human societies in order to conceive new systems for our future.</p>\n<p>First, however, it is prudent to come to adequate agreement as to what those first two words mean.</p>\n<p>These days, it seems that both words – Capitalism and Communism – have come to mean something other than ways of organizing an economy and distributing the goods produced therein. <a href=\"http://www.historyworld.net/wrldhis/plaintexthistories.asp?historyid=aa49\">Capitalism</a>, then, relates to an economy based upon the accumulation and investment of particularly large piles of wealth to generate economic returns, a meaning utterly lost when the term has been watered down to something more akin to “freedom” or “warm, good, happy feelings of positivity.” Capitalism <a href=\"https://news.mikecallicrate.com/gods-and-radicals-neither-capitalism-nor-socialism-a-third-alternative/\">isn’t the same</a> as simply having markets or engaging in trade. Although elements of capitalism are evident in, say, the forbidden medieval practice of usury (lending money to be repaid with interest), it really came into its own with such innovations as the chartered <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/0f1ec9da-c9a6-11e9-af46-b09e8bfe60c0\">East India Company</a> in the 18th century, which began the process of ravaging the subcontinent for private profit.</p>\n<p>Likewise, “communism” has come to mean “bad, evil things that inspire feelings of unhappiness” rather than “an economic system in which the major means of production are <a href=\"https://www.britannica.com/topic/communism\">owned and controlled by the public</a>,” with the aim of a classless, stateless society. In 20th century practice, this has often meant a state-controlled economy, though today’s anarchist-communists envision <a href=\"https://libcom.org/article/anarchist-communism-introduction\">independent, egalitarian communities</a> managing their own economic needs. Doubtless, private owners of capital would prefer that the idea of public collectivization of wealth be widely associated with grim, fearful feelings (similar to the way many economically disadvantaged poors feel about the word “capitalism” these days), but such emotional redefinition does little to advance the worthy goal of creating an economy that works for as many people as possible (and, importantly, doesn’t destroy the natural world on which our lives depend).</p>\n<a href=\"https://www.legalreader.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Karl_Marx_1875.jpg\"><img src=\"https://www.legalreader.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Karl_Marx_1875.jpg\" alt=\"Vintage photograph of a man with bushy, white hair and beard, seated, wearing formal clothes.\" width=\"300\" height=\"380\" /></a>Karl Marx, acknowledged father of revolutionary communist theory.

How else could an economy possibly be organized?</p>\n<p>Perhaps the oldest system is the <a href=\"https://maggieappleton.com/gift-economy\">gift economy</a>. When humans lived together in small bands, often at least partially nomadic, one depended upon one’s tribe to live. Food was shared; there were social rules about how to parcel out a hunter’s kill. Those who accumulated too much or acted too greedily may have been <a href=\"https://www.sapiens.org/culture/hunter-gatherer-inequality-namibia/\">mocked and humbled</a> by their peers, ensuring that resources were spread widely. Gifts of food, tools, or other objects were regularly exchanged, and while everyone knew the score, not reciprocating similarly at some point was shameful. If you’ve ever attended a seed swap, a supper club, or even Christmas morning, you’ve taken part in a gift economy, where the best way to invest one’s excess is in one’s friends.</p>\n<p>Later came the <a href=\"https://ecotalker.wordpress.com/2020/09/16/totw-palace-economy/\">palace economy</a>. Greater control of a larger population enabled central elites to organize the production and distribution of goods. Land and materials may be provided, such as in the Inca Empire, where different villages were assigned different kinds of production. Finished goods would be collected at a central location, such as a palace or <a href=\"https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/iraq/article/abs/origins-of-the-templeeconomy-as-seen-in-the-light-of-prehistoric-evidence/E6CED755CA475E624BFCD64BAB3B2212\">temple</a> (since state and religious power were mingled, a condition some among us would prefer even now). Authorities would then redistribute the goods as they saw fit, whether around the kingdom to those that needed them, as trade goods with other polities, gifts to form alliances, financing a military, or what have you. A similar modern equivalent might be <a href=\"https://archive.foodfirst.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/PB11-Famine-in-North-Korea-Christine-Ahn.pdf\">North Korea’s version of state communism</a>, where the government decides what grains farmers are to grow, and redistributes whatever grain is produced back to the people “according to need” (and availability).</p>\n<p>You likely heard about the next one in school: <a href=\"https://www.worldhistory.org/Feudalism/\">feudalism</a>, the dominant economic system of medieval Europe, among other regions. Land (the most important means of production) was owned by the monarch, who lent control of it to the nobility in exchange for the promise of military support in war. Nobility lent smaller parcels to knights, who promised to fight. Knights then provided peasantry with land, in exchange for labor and a share of produce. The details and customs varied from place to place, of course, and the Church complicated it even more, but however <a href=\"https://www.worldhistory.org/image/15424/the-feudal-society-in-medieval-europe/\">hierarchal</a> and oppressive, feudalism was a relatively efficient answer to the circumstances of the time. Nowadays, <a href=\"https://lareviewofbooks.org/article/neofeudalism-the-end-of-capitalism/\">we don’t have to look far</a> for the modern equivalent of a low-mobility landless underclass who serve their more wealthy ‘betters.’</p>\n<p>Indigenous tribes of the salmon-rich Pacific Northwest devised <a href=\"https://www.law.gmu.edu/assets/files/publications/working_papers/1605.pdf\">the potlatch economy</a>. Any chief who wanted to remain in that position would do so by ordering a potlatch ceremony and inviting outsiders to attend. By commanding as much production of feast foods and gifts as that tribe could afford, and giving it away in abundance during the ceremony, the chief could earn prestige as the richest and most generous, the rightful big man. As in the gift economy, a mental tally was kept and reciprocity expected, with any shortfall resulting in the loss of political prestige. Organized as a way of allocating political power, it was also an effective way of distributing goods from those with more to those with less.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://distributistreview.com/archive/an-introduction-to-distributism\">Distributism</a> is a lesser-known economic philosophy with its roots in Catholicism. Rather than the means of production being concentrated in the hands of the rich, or run by a government bureaucracy, the main goal of distributism is to <a href=\"https://modjourn.org/essay/distributism/\">spread the ownership of property and the means of production as widely as possible</a>. This could <a href=\"http://static1.squarespace.com/static/5e486131a9ec956ab43c1f8e/5e4862202773074a5cd60bb2/5e4862232773074a5cd60de4/1581802019229/wallst.pdf?format=original\">mean</a> a great many mom-and-pop shops, worker-owned co-ops, small diverse farms, and independent contractors. Sure, the lack of vast accumulations of capital would mean fewer giant corporations, but that price might be worth paying if it means that everyone had the means to sustain themselves.</p>\n<p>Socialism has become as emotionally loaded a term as capitalism or communism, but what is it really? Opinions vary, but in the democratic socialist, Nordic model held up by the likes of Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, there’s still a capitalist, market economy. Some of the most essential human needs, which aren’t always met by the market, are simply <a href=\"https://jacobin.com/2020/05/capitalism-socialism-cooperatives-market-nhs-democracy\">made available alongside and outside</a> of it, funded by public taxation (that is, <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/2016/9/1/12732168/economic-freedom-score-america-welfare-state\">skimming a bit of the productivity off of a capitalist economy</a> in order to make it serve more people). Major examples would be the British National Health Service, social security payments to the elderly, or state-owned banks that do not need to operate at a profit because their mission is more human-centric.</p>\n<p>As you can see, beyond capitalism and communism lies an impressive array of other ways to live. In practice, no single economic system takes care of all needs perfectly. We live in such a mix, where we may work for a capitalist, receive food assistance benefits (SNAP) to subsidize an insufficient wage, trade baby clothes with a moms’ group, and take advantage of a community garden plot or CSA share.</p>\n<p>Looking around, however, it’s easy to see that the dominant form of American capitalism isn’t working for everyone. There are homeless people and people-less homes. Vast amounts of food are wasted, yet there are hungry people. We’re destroying the landbase and creating mountains of trash. Increasingly, people are impatient to find a better way, although their imaginations usually <a href=\"https://news.mikecallicrate.com/gods-and-radicals-neither-capitalism-nor-socialism-a-third-alternative/\">settle into two</a> opposing and circularly-arguing camps.

Many of the loudest American voices seem attached to minds which can only think in binary terms: white/black, Democrat/Republican, Capitalist/Communist, freedom/slavery, good/evil. How much more there is, for those who care to see! Beyond capitalism lies more than just “it must be Communism,” and it’s worth exploring ideas that have served other human societies in order to conceive new systems for our future.\nFirst, however, it is prudent to come to adequate agreement as to what those first two words mean.\nThese days, it seems that both words – Capitalism and Communism – have come to mean something other than ways of organizing an economy and distributing the goods produced therein. Capitalism, then, relates to an economy based upon the accumulation and investment of particularly large piles of wealth to generate economic returns, a meaning utterly lost when the term has been watered down to something more akin to “freedom” or “warm, good, happy feelings of positivity.” Capitalism isn’t the same as simply having markets or engaging in trade. Although elements of capitalism are evident in, say, the forbidden medieval practice of usury (lending money to be repaid with interest), it really came into its own with such innovations as the chartered East India Company in the 18th century, which began the process of ravaging the subcontinent for private profit.\nLikewise, “communism” has come to mean “bad, evil things that inspire feelings of unhappiness” rather than “an economic system in which the major means of production are owned and controlled by the public,” with the aim of a classless, stateless society. In 20th century practice, this has often meant a state-controlled economy, though today’s anarchist-communists envision independent, egalitarian communities managing their own economic needs. Doubtless, private owners of capital would prefer that the idea of public collectivization of wealth be widely associated with grim, fearful feelings (similar to the way many economically disadvantaged poors feel about the word “capitalism” these days), but such emotional redefinition does little to advance the worthy goal of creating an economy that works for as many people as possible (and, importantly, doesn’t destroy the natural world on which our lives depend).\nKarl Marx, acknowledged father of revolutionary communist theory.

How else could an economy possibly be organized?\nPerhaps the oldest system is the gift economy. When humans lived together in small bands, often at least partially nomadic, one depended upon one’s tribe to live. Food was shared; there were social rules about how to parcel out a hunter’s kill. Those who accumulated too much or acted too greedily may have been mocked and humbled by their peers, ensuring that resources were spread widely. Gifts of food, tools, or other objects were regularly exchanged, and while everyone knew the score, not reciprocating similarly at some point was shameful. If you’ve ever attended a seed swap, a supper club, or even Christmas morning, you’ve taken part in a gift economy, where the best way to invest one’s excess is in one’s friends.\nLater came the palace economy. Greater control of a larger population enabled central elites to organize the production and distribution of goods. Land and materials may be provided, such as in the Inca Empire, where different villages were assigned different kinds of production. Finished goods would be collected at a central location, such as a palace or temple (since state and religious power were mingled, a condition some among us would prefer even now). Authorities would then redistribute the goods as they saw fit, whether around the kingdom to those that needed them, as trade goods with other polities, gifts to form alliances, financing a military, or what have you. A similar modern equivalent might be North Korea’s version of state communism, where the government decides what grains farmers are to grow, and redistributes whatever grain is produced back to the people “according to need” (and availability).\nYou likely heard about the next one in school: feudalism, the dominant economic system of medieval Europe, among other regions. Land (the most important means of production) was owned by the monarch, who lent control of it to the nobility in exchange for the promise of military support in war. Nobility lent smaller parcels to knights, who promised to fight. Knights then provided peasantry with land, in exchange for labor and a share of produce. The details and customs varied from place to place, of course, and the Church complicated it even more, but however hierarchal and oppressive, feudalism was a relatively efficient answer to the circumstances of the time. Nowadays, we don’t have to look far for the modern equivalent of a low-mobility landless underclass who serve their more wealthy ‘betters.’\nIndigenous tribes of the salmon-rich Pacific Northwest devised the potlatch economy. Any chief who wanted to remain in that position would do so by ordering a potlatch ceremony and inviting outsiders to attend. By commanding as much production of feast foods and gifts as that tribe could afford, and giving it away in abundance during the ceremony, the chief could earn prestige as the richest and most generous, the rightful big man. As in the gift economy, a mental tally was kept and reciprocity expected, with any shortfall resulting in the loss of political prestige. Organized as a way of allocating political power, it was also an effective way of distributing goods from those with more to those with less.\nDistributism is a lesser-known economic philosophy with its roots in Catholicism. Rather than the means of production being concentrated in the hands of the rich, or run by a government bureaucracy, the main goal of distributism is to spread the ownership of property and the means of production as widely as possible. This could mean a great many mom-and-pop shops, worker-owned co-ops, small diverse farms, and independent contractors. Sure, the lack of vast accumulations of capital would mean fewer giant corporations, but that price might be worth paying if it means that everyone had the means to sustain themselves.\nSocialism has become as emotionally loaded a term as capitalism or communism, but what is it really? Opinions vary, but in the democratic socialist, Nordic model held up by the likes of Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, there’s still a capitalist, market economy. Some of the most essential human needs, which aren’t always met by the market, are simply made available alongside and outside of it, funded by public taxation (that is, skimming a bit of the productivity off of a capitalist economy in order to make it serve more people). Major examples would be the British National Health Service, social security payments to the elderly, or state-owned banks that do not need to operate at a profit because their mission is more human-centric.\nAs you can see, beyond capitalism and communism lies an impressive array of other ways to live. In practice, no single economic system takes care of all needs perfectly. We live in such a mix, where we may work for a capitalist, receive food assistance benefits (SNAP) to subsidize an insufficient wage, trade baby clothes with a moms’ group, and take advantage of a community garden plot or CSA share.\nLooking around, however, it’s easy to see that the dominant form of American capitalism isn’t working for everyone. There are homeless people and people-less homes. Vast amounts of food are wasted, yet there are hungry people. We’re destroying the landbase and creating mountains of trash. Increasingly, people are impatient to find a better way, although their imaginations usually settle into two opposing and circularly-arguing camps. It’s a situation that could desperately use an injection of fresh ideas, because the system is failing. Sooner than later, we’ll have to figure out how to produce and distribute what people need, beyond capitalism.

        "html": "<p>Today I saw something at <a href=\"https://dataconnect.api.gov.uk/index\">DataConnect</a> that got me very excited. Mainly because it’s work I’d like to re-use in a future work project, but also because it’s work that combined some areas I’ve got skills in.</p>\n\n<p>The session was called <a href=\"https://dataconnect.api.gov.uk/dc22/#3:00pm-to-3:30pm-Searching-for-data,-not-just-for-datasets\">‘Searching for data, not just for datasets’</a> and is looking at making it easier to search for data. For example, if you want to answer the question ‘How many cars did the UK export last year?’, wouldn’t it be nice to search for <em>that</em>? You know, instead of having to</p>\n\n<ul><li>find out which organisation publishes data about cars and where</li>\n  <li>wonder whether their datasets about cars include data about exports too</li>\n  <li>find the statistical release for the year you’re interested in</li>\n  <li>get the data, work out that someone else entirely publishes data about exports</li>\n  <li>bang the keyboard and start looking again</li>\n</ul><p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/robsteranium\">Robin</a> and <a href=\"https://github.com/rossbowen\">Ross</a> showed how they’d been tinkering with Elasticsearch to make it return results from datasets in response to natural language queries (see the <a href=\"https://search-prototype.gss-data.org.uk\">prototype</a>). For a few queries I tried, the results it returned were iffy, but they’re collecting feedback on the results. (We systemised collecting feedback on the GOV.UK Search team and built a <a href=\"https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-search-relevance-tool\">search relevance tool</a> to help, so I shared that with them.)</p>\n\n<p>They’re also working on making those results more findable by surfacing ontologies and classifications (in RDF) that describe the data to Google (in JSON-LD) – part of the <a href=\"https://www.w3.org/TR/dwbp/\">Data on the Web Best Practices</a> and <a href=\"https://developers.google.com/search/docs/appearance/structured-data/intro-structured-data\">how Google understands structured data</a>.</p>\n\n<p>All of this got me excited because people use data (and other information) to answer questions. And Robin and Ross are working on making those answers more findable. Making answers to common research questions more findable is an area I expect to have to look at soon-ish.</p>\n\n<p>Making those answers more findable inside a product will help our existing users, but making the answers findable on the web would be a <a href=\"https://www.reforge.com/blog/growth-loops\">growth loop</a>. It would help us find new prospective users and help support our users’ community of practice.</p>\n\n<p>I know that sounds like VC-backed, rocketship startup bullshit, so I should point out that it wouldn’t only benefit us. It would benefit the public good because these are common research questions, and people are already looking for our data to answer those. It shouldn’t be an arcane process to find this stuff.</p>\n\n<p>To nab from Maggie Appleton’s <a href=\"https://maggieappleton.com/block-data\">talk on data blocks</a>: better user experiences leads to better data science which leads to better decision-making tools.</p>\n\n<p><em>P.S. This note is squarely aimed at my future self, so that I come back to it if/when that project starts. But if this interests you too, drop me a line. Let’s chat!</em></p>\n\n<h2>Some history, for context</h2>\n\n<p>While hanging out some washing this evening, it occurred to me why I was so interested in this. TL;DR: I’ve got intellectual skin in the game. These problems have been part of my work for the last 8 years.</p>\n\n<p>This stuff first interested me around 2014 or 2015 when I was working at <a href=\"https://porism.com\">Porism</a>. I was tasked with increasing engagement with a reporting tool they’d built for councils, which helps council officers get statistical data about the people living in the council’s boundaries. The data helps support policy decisions and service design, so making it easier for people to use that data was a thing on my plate.</p>\n\n<p>One issue was helping people get to grips with the tool.

        "text": "Today I saw something at DataConnect that got me very excited. Mainly because it’s work I’d like to re-use in a future work project, but also because it’s work that combined some areas I’ve got skills in.\n\nThe session was called ‘Searching for data, not just for datasets’ and is looking at making it easier to search for data. For example, if you want to answer the question ‘How many cars did the UK export last year?’, wouldn’t it be nice to search for that? You know, instead of having to\n\nfind out which organisation publishes data about cars and where\n  wonder whether their datasets about cars include data about exports too\n  find the statistical release for the year you’re interested in\n  get the data, work out that someone else entirely publishes data about exports\n  bang the keyboard and start looking again\nRobin and Ross showed how they’d been tinkering with Elasticsearch to make it return results from datasets in response to natural language queries (see the prototype). For a few queries I tried, the results it returned were iffy, but they’re collecting feedback on the results. (We systemised collecting feedback on the GOV.UK Search team and built a search relevance tool to help, so I shared that with them.)\n\nThey’re also working on making those results more findable by surfacing ontologies and classifications (in RDF) that describe the data to Google (in JSON-LD) – part of the Data on the Web Best Practices and how Google understands structured data.\n\nAll of this got me excited because people use data (and other information) to answer questions. And Robin and Ross are working on making those answers more findable. Making answers to common research questions more findable is an area I expect to have to look at soon-ish.\n\nMaking those answers more findable inside a product will help our existing users, but making the answers findable on the web would be a growth loop. It would help us find new prospective users and help support our users’ community of practice.\n\nI know that sounds like VC-backed, rocketship startup bullshit, so I should point out that it wouldn’t only benefit us. It would benefit the public good because these are common research questions, and people are already looking for our data to answer those. It shouldn’t be an arcane process to find this stuff.\n\nTo nab from Maggie Appleton’s talk on data blocks: better user experiences leads to better data science which leads to better decision-making tools.\n\nP.S. This note is squarely aimed at my future self, so that I come back to it if/when that project starts. But if this interests you too, drop me a line. Let’s chat!\n\nSome history, for context\n\nWhile hanging out some washing this evening, it occurred to me why I was so interested in this. TL;DR: I’ve got intellectual skin in the game. These problems have been part of my work for the last 8 years.\n\nThis stuff first interested me around 2014 or 2015 when I was working at Porism. I was tasked with increasing engagement with a reporting tool they’d built for councils, which helps council officers get statistical data about the people living in the council’s boundaries. The data helps support policy decisions and service design, so making it easier for people to use that data was a thing on my plate.\n\nOne issue was helping people get to grips with the tool. It’s pretty powerful, you can answer a lot of questions with it, but people found it hard to get started or to know how to ask their question. Engagement suffered as a result. There were lots of drop-downs and query builders and the like. The interface didn’t match users’ initial mental models.\n\nBut what makes the tool powerful are the data standards behind it all, how it links together (for example)\n\nthe concept of homelessness\n  services related to homelessness\n  legal duties related to homelessness\n  data about homelessness\nand links all that to other useful data like\n\nthe age of homeless people in your area\n  the number of people in different age ranges in your area\nso that you can do some analysis.\nThe problem was all about making answers to questions findable, but by the time I got close to having the skills to answer it (through product management and user-centred design), I’d moved on to work at GDS.\n\nWhile at GDS, I looked after GOV.UK’s site search for a year. I wrote about how we were going to make site search work smarter for users in order to make results more relevant to a user’s query. It meant I got pretty deep into indexing strategies, taxonomies, and the similarity of words. But we looked at interaction patterns and common components in search experiences too.

Like: Why do our brains work the way they do?</p>\n<p>Two years ago, <a href=\"https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey/2020?_ga=2.170070816.1891439336.1663612814-336533442.1635866663#technology-already-visited-feeling\">we asked</a> how you feel when you search for an answer and find a purple link—that is, a previously-clicked one. <a href=\"https://stackoverflow.blog/2020/06/19/searching-for-answers-and-finding-purple-links-youre-not-alone/\">Fifty-two percent</a> of you described your reaction as “Hello, old friend”: meaning you’ve searched for and located this information before. Maybe you’re trying to remember <a href=\"https://stackoverflow.blog/2017/05/23/stack-overflow-helping-one-million-developers-exit-vim/\">how to exit Vim (again)</a>, or maybe you just need to grab a specific regex. Either way, that purple link is reassuring—and, perhaps, exactly what you were looking for.</p>\n<p>With more than half of developers greeting purple links like old friends (and another 16% reacting with amusement), it was apparent that people were visiting the same questions repeatedly. In fact, we found that <a href=\"https://stackoverflow.blog/2022/06/22/asked-and-answered-the-results-for-the-2022-developer-survey-are-here/\">62%</a> of Stack Overflow’s regular users visited the same question more than once in a three-month span. </p>\n<p>Clearly, many of us are eager to outsource the work of information recall by treating external information repositories (especially those rich in user-generated content, such as Stack Overflow and Reddit) as second brains: personal knowledge management systems supported by technology.</p>\n<p>This got us thinking: Is this an effective use of brainpower? Does the space we free up by deploying a second brain get used productively for something else? Or is relying on a second brain a lazy habit that leaves us less knowledgeable, capable of making fewer connections?</p>\n<p>When I was doing my doctoral work in English and new media studies, I had a tendency to use Wikipedia to keep track of high-level definitions and straightforward details, like when a book was published or when a historical event happened. The definition of “epistemology” stubbornly refused to stick in my head, as did the year Ray Bradbury first published “<a href=\"http://www.astro.sunysb.edu/fwalter/AST389/ASoundofThunder.pdf\">A Sound of Thunder</a>,” so I found myself searching for this information once a week or so, clicking that friendly purple link every time.</p>\n<p>Another example: I’ve been making the same oatmeal cookie recipe for years, but I have yet to memorize it; I just Google it whenever I have a craving. Effectively, I rely on the search bar and the purple link to remember the recipe for me.</p>\n<p>Why is it easier or more expedient to call up the same information over and over again, rather than committing it to memory? What does our dependence on second brains tell us about the way we learn and work? And for developers, who are constantly deluged with new and complex information, how can the right second brain help your original brain work better?</p>\n<h2><span>What is a second brain?</span></h2>\n<p>A second brain is a personal knowledge management system, especially one enabled by technology. The term is often credited to thought leader and author Tiago Forte, whose <a href=\"https://www.buildingasecondbrain.com/\">Building a Second Brain</a> course has done a lot to popularize the concept. (These <a href=\"https://maggieappleton.com/basb\">illustrated notes</a> do a great job of summarizing the course material.) More specifically…</p>\n<h3><span>A second brain is a way of capturing and organizing information to realize its value</span></h3>\n<p>A second brain helps you get a handle on the volume and complexity of information you’re exposed to at virtually all times, with the eventual goal of translating that knowledge into something useful. This is especially critical for developers and other people whose work involves constant exposure to an ever-expanding pool of complex, technical information. Without help from the structures and technologies that comprise a second brain, you can’t absorb or remember the information you’re immersed in, much less call up that information when you might need it to solve a future problem or kick off a new project.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>One simply siphons the excess thoughts from one’s mind, pours them into the basin, and examines them at one’s leisure.</p>\n<p>Albus Dumbledore</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<img width=\"420\" height=\"630\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/rssfeeds.cloudsite.builders/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Pensieve-1-420x630-1.jpeg?resize=420%2C630&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"Pensieve 1 420x630 1\" title=\"Two heads are better than one: What second brains say about how developers work 1\" />\n<img width=\"420\" height=\"630\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/rssfeeds.cloudsite.builders/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Pensieve-1-420x630-1.jpeg?resize=420%2C630&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"Pensieve 1 420x630 1\" title=\"Two heads are better than one: What second brains say about how developers work 1\" />\nHarshLight from San Jose, CA, USA, CC BY 2.0 <a href=\"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/2.0\">https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/2.0</a>, via Wikimedia Commons\n<p>In the <em>Harry Potter </em>series, Dumbledore’s <a href=\"https://tenor.com/bkvFW.gif\">Pensieve</a> serves a second-brain function, storing disconnected thoughts and memories and shaping them into coherent patterns to inform actions and decisions. “One simply siphons the excess thoughts from one’s mind, pours them into the basin, and examines them at one’s leisure,” explains Dumbledore. “It becomes easier to spot patterns and links, you understand, when they are in this form.”</p>\n<h3><span>A second brain reduces cognitive load by doing your thinking and remembering for you</span></h3>\n<p>Think of a second brain as <a href=\"https://aseemthakar.com/how-to-build-a-second-brain-as-a-software-developer/\">an extension of your mind</a>: somewhere you can offload cognitive work so you don’t have to struggle to remember information or put it to good use. Like Sherlock Holmes’s <a href=\"https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/the-memory-factory/202105/use-sherlock-holmes-mind-palace-technique-improve-your-memory\">mind palace</a>, a second brain is a system for collecting, storing, and curating the tide of information that continually washes over us. “It’s a way of ensuring that the ludicrous amount of information we have to deal with day-to-day stops bouncing around our heads and is recorded somewhere where we can make sense of it in the long term,” <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-mpBC83l1dY\">explains</a> Stack Overflow developer advocate and evangelist Matt Kiernander. </p>\n<h3><span>A second brain is built on digital technology</span></h3>\n<p>It’s certainly possible to cobble together a second brain using manual methods, from a notebook to a filing cabinet to a wall plastered with sticky notes. In college, I took notes in the margins of secondhand books as I read, blithely assuming I would remember what my scribbled abbreviations meant (spoiler: I would not, nor would the bookstore buy back any of my books).</p>\n<p>None of these analog methods is scalable, portable, searchable, or capable of handling data in any format—all essential qualities in the kind of second brain you need. Unless you have access to a Pensieve, I suppose, a digital second brain is far and away the best and most natural choice for most of us who sit in front of computers all day. Your second brain must be: </p>\n<ul><li>\n<strong>Scalable</strong>, so you can capture and preserve a virtually unlimited amount of information.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Capable of storing and organizing data in various formats</strong>, from images to videos to chunks of code.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Portable</strong>, to permit quick capture and editing of information.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Searchable</strong>, so you can easily pull up the knowledge you need when you need it.</li>\n</ul><h4><span>What platforms are developers using as their second brains?</span></h4>\n<p>We’re awfully proud of the fact that <a href=\"https://stackoverflow.blog/2020/06/19/searching-for-answers-and-finding-purple-links-youre-not-alone/\">90%</a> of developers turn to Stack Overflow when they get stuck, often via a <a href=\"https://www.wordstream.com/navigational-query\">navigational query</a>. (For example, “how to exit vim stack overflow” will take you to <a href=\"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/11828270/how-do-i-exit-vim\">this question</a>, viewed 2.7 million times and counting.) Often, developers return to the same question or answer regularly. <a href=\"https://stackoverflow.blog/2022/06/22/asked-and-answered-the-results-for-the-2022-developer-survey-are-here/\">More than 60%</a> of regular Stack Overflow users visit the same question more than once in a three-month period—so if you’re thinking, “Didn’t I <em>just </em>look this up?”, the answer is probably yes. </p>\n<p>These findings reveal how many developers rely on our public platform to serve a second-brain function. Most developers are inundated with information: languages, libraries, frameworks, and tools with their own use cases, shortcuts, workarounds, and optimizations. Second brains tailored for developers’ needs help us capture, organize, and surface knowledge, reducing cognitive load while realizing more value from the knowledge we’re exposed to.</p>\n<p>Other second-brain tools developers favor include <a href=\"https://www.notionsecondbrain.com/\">Notion</a> (whose digital system is actually called Second Brain), <a href=\"https://obsidian.md/\">Obsidian</a> (which bills itself as a personal second brain), <a href=\"https://evernote.com/\">Evernote</a>, and <a href=\"https://roamresearch.com/\">Roam</a>, just to name a few.</p>\n<h2><span>What does our reliance on second brains reveal about how we think and work?</span></h2>\n<p>Knowing that so many of us rely on second brains, we wondered what this dependence could tell us about human memory and cognition, especially when it comes to developers and how they work. </p>\n<h3><span>We need help accessing knowledge and memories over time</span></h3>\n<p>In his 2001 book <em>The Seven Sins of Memory: How the Mind Forgets and Remembers</em>, Harvard researcher Daniel Schacter defines seven “sins of memory,” including transience and absentmindedness, the two failings most relevant to us here. </p>\n<p>Transience refers to memories that simply don’t stick in our minds, or “the decreasing accessibility of memory over time,” according to the <a href=\"https://www.apa.org/monitor/oct03/sins\">American Psychological Association</a>. This usually involves new information that you’re trying to remember, from an unfamiliar function to the name of that person you were just introduced to.</p>\n<p>Absentmindedness refers to “lapses of attention and forgetting to do things,” per the <a href=\"https://www.apa.org/monitor/oct03/sins\">APA</a>. “This sin operates both when a memory is formed (the encoding stage) and when a memory is accessed (the retrieval stage).” Classic examples of absentmindedness: forgetting where you left your phone, accidentally throwing away <a href=\"https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2021/12/13/half-a-billion-in-bitcoin-lost-in-the-dump\">half a billion in Bitcoin</a>, or leaving your <a href=\"https://www.classicfm.com/artists/yo-yo-ma/stradivarius-cello-left-in-new-york-taxi/\">$3.5 million cello</a> in the back of a cab.</p>\n<p>A second brain helps us overcome transience and absentmindedness by allowing us to categorize, search, and retrieve information and experiences. Ideally, a second brain empowers you to work “more effectively in the moment,” <a href=\"https://fortelabs.co/blog/the-7-benefits-of-building-a-second-brain/\">writes</a> Tiago Forte: “You can spin up and complete your projects far faster because you’re starting with a collection of valuable material and reusing work you’ve already performed instead of a blank page.”</p>\n<h3><span>We’re overloaded with information…</span></h3>\n<p>As we’ve <a href=\"https://stackoverflow.blog/2020/06/19/searching-for-answers-and-finding-purple-links-youre-not-alone/\">previously covered</a>, there’s <a href=\"https://www.encyclopedia.com/psychology/encyclopedias-almanacs-transcripts-and-maps/attention-and-memory\">a strong correlation</a> between how much attention we give something and our ability to remember it later. Both transience and absentmindedness are exacerbated when we’re unable to focus, and chronic multitasking can cause us to perform worse on simple memory and cognition tests, according to <a href=\"https://news.stanford.edu/2018/10/25/decade-data-reveals-heavy-multitaskers-reduced-memory-psychologist-says/\">a study</a> from the Stanford Memory Laboratory. <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3656338/\">Things get even harder</a> for people experiencing significant stress and anxiety at work, whether those feelings stem from clinical anxiety or a professional culture of looming deadlines, unsupportive managers, and unrealistic expectations. </p>\n<p>Most developers encounter constant, overlapping distractions: pings from chat and email programs, urgent tickets, the need to write code while joining calls and preparing for other meetings. In such a noisy environment, it’s no wonder that things slip your mind. Information overload leads to information exhaustion: We’re exposed to so much information every day that we simply can’t absorb and remember it all without an assist from technology. If you’ll pardon the plug, this is why companies like <a href=\"https://resources.stackoverflow.co/topic/client-stories/microsoft-case-study/\">Microsoft</a>, <a href=\"https://resources.stackoverflow.co/topic/client-stories/dropbox-case-study/\">Dropbox</a>, and <a href=\"https://resources.stackoverflow.co/topic/client-stories/elastic-case-study\">Elastic</a> use <a href=\"https://stackoverflow.co/teams/\">Stack Overflow for Teams</a> as an organization-wide second brain, to ease the cognitive burden of constant context-switching and to manage collective knowledge.</p>\n<h3><span>…but we don’t want to miss anything</span></h3>\n<p>While most of us are all-too-aware of our information exhaustion, it’s still a priority for us to absorb and retain as much information as possible, especially as we move from project to project or job to job. But that’s much easier said than done. Developers face a proliferation of programming languages, frameworks, libraries, and tools, all of which have various, sometimes-overlapping applications, best practices, common pitfalls, and so on. No wonder some feel there’s simply <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/uud5dm/too_much_to_learn_web_development_sde/\">too much to learn</a>.</p>\n<p>A second brain allows us to reduce noise and manage information overload without worrying that scraps of invaluable knowledge will slip through the cracks while we have 800 different mental tabs open. “By outsourcing the job of remembering to an external tool,” <a href=\"https://fortelabs.co/blog/the-7-benefits-of-building-a-second-brain/\">writes</a> Forte, “we gain the peace of mind of knowing exactly what to do with each piece of incoming information and the confidence that it will never be forgotten.”</p>\n<p>Matt Kiernander <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-mpBC83l1dY\">points out</a> that a second brain is enormously helpful for retaining the knowledge you’ll need for repeatable tasks. If, like Matt, you find yourself Googling how to set up PATH variables for your command line every time you set up a new environment, or trying to remember the predefined list of tools and npm packages you need to install, offloading that information to a second brain could save you hours of time and didn’t-I-used-to-know-this frustration.</p>\n<p>Second brains also allow you to make the knowledge you acquire as you move between jobs and projects portable, so that you can bring information like useful code snippets with you on your professional journey. The same goes for using your second brain to document the educational resources you encounter as you learn different technologies, languages, and systems.</p>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://resources.stackoverflow.co/topic/thought-leadership/prioritize-learning/\">best developers</a> are <a href=\"https://towardsdatascience.com/great-developers-never-stop-learning-77b9ce867eac\">constantly learning</a>: reskilling and upskilling, mastering new systems, adding additional languages and technologies to their repertoires. Instead of information going in one ear and out the other, a second brain “helps you take control of your own learning,” <a href=\"https://fortelabs.co/blog/the-7-benefits-of-building-a-second-brain/\">says</a> Forte, curating your learnings in a searchable format you can return to anytime you need to.  </p>\n<h2><span>Innovation is rooted in knowledge</span></h2>\n<p>When you can access information from your personal knowledge store when you need it, you can apply that wealth of experience to new skills and new projects. The idea is to surround yourself with context-rich associations and priceless nuggets of insight and problem-solving that you’ve collected and stored over time—the contents of your mind palace. The value of a second brain goes way beyond reminding you (once again) how to exit Vim or how much brown sugar your favorite cookies call for.

Like: Why do our brains work the way they do?\nTwo years ago, we asked how you feel when you search for an answer and find a purple link—that is, a previously-clicked one. Fifty-two percent of you described your reaction as “Hello, old friend”: meaning you’ve searched for and located this information before. Maybe you’re trying to remember how to exit Vim (again), or maybe you just need to grab a specific regex. Either way, that purple link is reassuring—and, perhaps, exactly what you were looking for.\nWith more than half of developers greeting purple links like old friends (and another 16% reacting with amusement), it was apparent that people were visiting the same questions repeatedly. In fact, we found that 62% of Stack Overflow’s regular users visited the same question more than once in a three-month span. \nClearly, many of us are eager to outsource the work of information recall by treating external information repositories (especially those rich in user-generated content, such as Stack Overflow and Reddit) as second brains: personal knowledge management systems supported by technology.\nThis got us thinking: Is this an effective use of brainpower? Does the space we free up by deploying a second brain get used productively for something else? Or is relying on a second brain a lazy habit that leaves us less knowledgeable, capable of making fewer connections?\nWhen I was doing my doctoral work in English and new media studies, I had a tendency to use Wikipedia to keep track of high-level definitions and straightforward details, like when a book was published or when a historical event happened. The definition of “epistemology” stubbornly refused to stick in my head, as did the year Ray Bradbury first published “A Sound of Thunder,” so I found myself searching for this information once a week or so, clicking that friendly purple link every time.\nAnother example: I’ve been making the same oatmeal cookie recipe for years, but I have yet to memorize it; I just Google it whenever I have a craving. Effectively, I rely on the search bar and the purple link to remember the recipe for me.\nWhy is it easier or more expedient to call up the same information over and over again, rather than committing it to memory? What does our dependence on second brains tell us about the way we learn and work? And for developers, who are constantly deluged with new and complex information, how can the right second brain help your original brain work better?\nWhat is a second brain?\nA second brain is a personal knowledge management system, especially one enabled by technology. The term is often credited to thought leader and author Tiago Forte, whose Building a Second Brain course has done a lot to popularize the concept. (These illustrated notes do a great job of summarizing the course material.) More specifically…\nA second brain is a way of capturing and organizing information to realize its value\nA second brain helps you get a handle on the volume and complexity of information you’re exposed to at virtually all times, with the eventual goal of translating that knowledge into something useful. This is especially critical for developers and other people whose work involves constant exposure to an ever-expanding pool of complex, technical information. Without help from the structures and technologies that comprise a second brain, you can’t absorb or remember the information you’re immersed in, much less call up that information when you might need it to solve a future problem or kick off a new project.\n\nOne simply siphons the excess thoughts from one’s mind, pours them into the basin, and examines them at one’s leisure.\nAlbus Dumbledore\n\n\n\nHarshLight from San Jose, CA, USA, CC BY 2.0 https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/2.0, via Wikimedia Commons\nIn the Harry Potter series, Dumbledore’s Pensieve serves a second-brain function, storing disconnected thoughts and memories and shaping them into coherent patterns to inform actions and decisions. “One simply siphons the excess thoughts from one’s mind, pours them into the basin, and examines them at one’s leisure,” explains Dumbledore. “It becomes easier to spot patterns and links, you understand, when they are in this form.”\nA second brain reduces cognitive load by doing your thinking and remembering for you\nThink of a second brain as an extension of your mind: somewhere you can offload cognitive work so you don’t have to struggle to remember information or put it to good use. Like Sherlock Holmes’s mind palace, a second brain is a system for collecting, storing, and curating the tide of information that continually washes over us. “It’s a way of ensuring that the ludicrous amount of information we have to deal with day-to-day stops bouncing around our heads and is recorded somewhere where we can make sense of it in the long term,” explains Stack Overflow developer advocate and evangelist Matt Kiernander. \nA second brain is built on digital technology\nIt’s certainly possible to cobble together a second brain using manual methods, from a notebook to a filing cabinet to a wall plastered with sticky notes. In college, I took notes in the margins of secondhand books as I read, blithely assuming I would remember what my scribbled abbreviations meant (spoiler: I would not, nor would the bookstore buy back any of my books).\nNone of these analog methods is scalable, portable, searchable, or capable of handling data in any format—all essential qualities in the kind of second brain you need. Unless you have access to a Pensieve, I suppose, a digital second brain is far and away the best and most natural choice for most of us who sit in front of computers all day. Your second brain must be: \n\nScalable, so you can capture and preserve a virtually unlimited amount of information.\n\nCapable of storing and organizing data in various formats, from images to videos to chunks of code.\n\nPortable, to permit quick capture and editing of information.\n\nSearchable, so you can easily pull up the knowledge you need when you need it.\nWhat platforms are developers using as their second brains?\nWe’re awfully proud of the fact that 90% of developers turn to Stack Overflow when they get stuck, often via a navigational query. (For example, “how to exit vim stack overflow” will take you to this question, viewed 2.7 million times and counting.) Often, developers return to the same question or answer regularly. More than 60% of regular Stack Overflow users visit the same question more than once in a three-month period—so if you’re thinking, “Didn’t I just look this up?”, the answer is probably yes. \nThese findings reveal how many developers rely on our public platform to serve a second-brain function. Most developers are inundated with information: languages, libraries, frameworks, and tools with their own use cases, shortcuts, workarounds, and optimizations. Second brains tailored for developers’ needs help us capture, organize, and surface knowledge, reducing cognitive load while realizing more value from the knowledge we’re exposed to.\nOther second-brain tools developers favor include Notion (whose digital system is actually called Second Brain), Obsidian (which bills itself as a personal second brain), Evernote, and Roam, just to name a few.\nWhat does our reliance on second brains reveal about how we think and work?\nKnowing that so many of us rely on second brains, we wondered what this dependence could tell us about human memory and cognition, especially when it comes to developers and how they work. \nWe need help accessing knowledge and memories over time\nIn his 2001 book The Seven Sins of Memory: How the Mind Forgets and Remembers, Harvard researcher Daniel Schacter defines seven “sins of memory,” including transience and absentmindedness, the two failings most relevant to us here. \nTransience refers to memories that simply don’t stick in our minds, or “the decreasing accessibility of memory over time,” according to the American Psychological Association. This usually involves new information that you’re trying to remember, from an unfamiliar function to the name of that person you were just introduced to.\nAbsentmindedness refers to “lapses of attention and forgetting to do things,” per the APA. “This sin operates both when a memory is formed (the encoding stage) and when a memory is accessed (the retrieval stage).” Classic examples of absentmindedness: forgetting where you left your phone, accidentally throwing away half a billion in Bitcoin, or leaving your $3.5 million cello in the back of a cab.\nA second brain helps us overcome transience and absentmindedness by allowing us to categorize, search, and retrieve information and experiences. Ideally, a second brain empowers you to work “more effectively in the moment,” writes Tiago Forte: “You can spin up and complete your projects far faster because you’re starting with a collection of valuable material and reusing work you’ve already performed instead of a blank page.”\nWe’re overloaded with information…\nAs we’ve previously covered, there’s a strong correlation between how much attention we give something and our ability to remember it later. Both transience and absentmindedness are exacerbated when we’re unable to focus, and chronic multitasking can cause us to perform worse on simple memory and cognition tests, according to a study from the Stanford Memory Laboratory. Things get even harder for people experiencing significant stress and anxiety at work, whether those feelings stem from clinical anxiety or a professional culture of looming deadlines, unsupportive managers, and unrealistic expectations. \nMost developers encounter constant, overlapping distractions: pings from chat and email programs, urgent tickets, the need to write code while joining calls and preparing for other meetings. In such a noisy environment, it’s no wonder that things slip your mind. Information overload leads to information exhaustion: We’re exposed to so much information every day that we simply can’t absorb and remember it all without an assist from technology. If you’ll pardon the plug, this is why companies like Microsoft, Dropbox, and Elastic use Stack Overflow for Teams as an organization-wide second brain, to ease the cognitive burden of constant context-switching and to manage collective knowledge.\n…but we don’t want to miss anything\nWhile most of us are all-too-aware of our information exhaustion, it’s still a priority for us to absorb and retain as much information as possible, especially as we move from project to project or job to job. But that’s much easier said than done. Developers face a proliferation of programming languages, frameworks, libraries, and tools, all of which have various, sometimes-overlapping applications, best practices, common pitfalls, and so on. No wonder some feel there’s simply too much to learn.\nA second brain allows us to reduce noise and manage information overload without worrying that scraps of invaluable knowledge will slip through the cracks while we have 800 different mental tabs open. “By outsourcing the job of remembering to an external tool,” writes Forte, “we gain the peace of mind of knowing exactly what to do with each piece of incoming information and the confidence that it will never be forgotten.”\nMatt Kiernander points out that a second brain is enormously helpful for retaining the knowledge you’ll need for repeatable tasks. If, like Matt, you find yourself Googling how to set up PATH variables for your command line every time you set up a new environment, or trying to remember the predefined list of tools and npm packages you need to install, offloading that information to a second brain could save you hours of time and didn’t-I-used-to-know-this frustration.\nSecond brains also allow you to make the knowledge you acquire as you move between jobs and projects portable, so that you can bring information like useful code snippets with you on your professional journey. The same goes for using your second brain to document the educational resources you encounter as you learn different technologies, languages, and systems.\nThe best developers are constantly learning: reskilling and upskilling, mastering new systems, adding additional languages and technologies to their repertoires. Instead of information going in one ear and out the other, a second brain “helps you take control of your own learning,” says Forte, curating your learnings in a searchable format you can return to anytime you need to.  \nInnovation is rooted in knowledge\nWhen you can access information from your personal knowledge store when you need it, you can apply that wealth of experience to new skills and new projects. The idea is to surround yourself with context-rich associations and priceless nuggets of insight and problem-solving that you’ve collected and stored over time—the contents of your mind palace. The value of a second brain goes way beyond reminding you (once again) how to exit Vim or how much brown sugar your favorite cookies call for. It’s about making your learnings, insights, and experiences accessible and actionable as you navigate your professional journey.\nThe post Two heads are better than one: What second brains say about how developers work appeared first on Stack Overflow Blog.\n\n\nShare this:\n\nTwitter\nFacebook\nLinkedIn\nReddit\nTumblr\nPinterest\nMore\n\nPrint\nPocket\n\nTelegram\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nRelated"

        "text": "Every day, I share on Twitter and LinkedIn a list of curated articles I read, resources and tools about UX Design, User Research, UI and mobile design, HTML, CSS, the web industry, some process, some inspiration, etc. This is an archive of everything I shared this week.\n#Now – what I’m up to\nThis week I talked about documenting accessibility for designers. at id24 conference. The video will be online soon, meanwhile, check my version of the talk and the slides.\nAlso, the Stephania is really growing. I’m super happy. She now has small leaves. I just hope the stem won’t break when those leaves will grow.\nWhat’s your favorite way or follow-up sentence to encourage people to go a little bit further in interviews (or tests)? For me it’s a gentle “anything else?” + silence. The silence it important. Let people the time to reflect. It’s ackward, true, but worth it.\nTL;DNR the one you should not miss\n#Semantic HTML\nLink or Button? Use an anchor element (link) when you need to connect two sources, use a button element when you need to let user perform a programmable action (like submitting a form, opening a dialog). As simple as that! by Ashlee M Boyer\nInteresting article\n#Accessibility\nHere’s the Too Long Didn’t Read of all the new things coming to WCAG 2.2\n\nInteresting article on what the new WCAG 2.2 criteria will mean also for the accessibility of the native mobile apps (on @dequesystems’s blog)\nVery interesting conversation by Marcy Sutton on the minimum 4:5:1 or 3:1 for button elements in interfaces, related also to their font-size.\n#User Interviews\nA nice little guide to User Interviews, from what those are, when you need them to planning, writing the guide, recruiting, moderation and analysis by @userinterviews\n\n(inception much hehe?)\n#Product Design\nSmall interesting toughs on Feature Creep. It’ easy to add features to a product, but at some point, you must be smart and also know when to clean the slate. This is why measuring after a feature was launched is really important!\n#Simplicity\nIn case you wonder why the design of Craiglist hasn’t changed much in the last 25 years, here’s an interview from his founder\nInspiration, fun experiments and great ideas\n#Typography\nNeed a nice font, with extra wonk? Why don’t you try Fraunces. It comes with roman and italic styles, and it’s a very nice variable font with a wonk axis!\n#Fun\nLet’s face it: we all design for the best case scenario, especially when it’s print design and advertisement. And them, things get messy. Meet fockups: a place to find mockups to display your designs in bad but realistic conditions.\n#GenerativeArt\nRemember Spirographs? Meet Rotae, a generative art collection based on the vast array of beautiful shapes that can appear from the seemingly simple process of letting circles rotate on (many more) circles\n#Music\nI love a good creative use of the web, so here we go: Music Theory Cheat Sheet: Keys, Scales, Chords, Notes & Intervals\n#Privacy #SocialMedia\nInteresting and quite scary project: @driesdepoorter used open cameras and AI to find how some Instagram photos were taken\nUseful tools and resources that will make your life easy\n#Patterns\nAn interesting catalogue of design patterns gathered from the observations and research of Maggie Appleton.

How about building a lego powered submarine?\nNews in the industry\n#Emojis\nSo, YES finally proper pink heart emoji, because this one was not playing nicely with the other hearts 💗.\n#Figma\n“Adobe acquires Figma, cue the memes“, yup, I’m here for the memes too.

        "html": "<p>In linea generale si tratta di approcci da seguire per scrivere note, appunti e idee con il fine di prenderci cura della nostra conoscenza personale.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Oggi ci focalizziamo su quella che è una <strong>Atomic Note</strong> – una delle caratteristiche delle Evergreen Note – intesa come l’unità più piccola di un concetto che non può essere ulteriormente diviso.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Alcune caratteristiche</h3>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>ogni nota è un singolo nodo a cui è possibile fare riferimento, è indipendente e può essere compresa senza ricorrere ad altre note;</li>\n<li>ogni idea favorisce il riutilizzo e la creazione di collegamenti;</li>\n<li>è più semplice trovare e stabilire relazioni tra le note;</li>\n<li>ci protegge dal consumo eccessivo di contenuti;</li>\n<li>si allena il pensiero attraverso la scrittura;</li>\n<li>è in continua evoluzione, collegamento dopo collegamento;</li>\n<li>è richiesto un maggiore impegno nella comprensione che ci allontana dall’accumulazione eccessiva;</li>\n<li>ci allontana dalle strutture gerarchiche;</li>\n<li>le idee migliori sono una combinazione di ciò che ci succede nella vita, di ciò che fa parte del nutrimento della nostra mente.</li>\n</ul><h3>L’origine del principio di atomicità</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Tra le prime persone che hanno descritto le Atomic Note e anche le Evergreen Note troviamo <a href=\"https://notes.andymatuschak.org/z4AX7pHAu5uUfmrq4K4zig9x8jmmF62XgaMXm\">Andy Matuschak</a> e <a href=\"https://zettelkasten.de/posts/create-zettel-from-reading-notes/\">Christian Tietze</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Il concetto si collega al sistema di Niklas Luhmann chiamato Zettelkasten e al concetto informatico di <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Separation_of_concerns\">Separation of Concerns</a>, che, in breve, significa segmentare un programma in sezioni distinte dove ogni sezione affronta un problema separato (l’arte di segmentare e di scomporre la ritroviamo anche nei progetti, nella gestione del tempo e nelle note).</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>I termini collegati</h3>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://notes.linkingyourthinking.com/Cards/BOAT+notes\">BOAT</a>: Block of Atomic Thought (la nota grezza e ancora acerba, che non è pronta per diventare una Evergreen Note).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Permanent Note o Literature Note: sono le note rielaborate con le nostre parole (è il momento in cui prendiamo le note grezze e scriviamo le nostre considerazioni).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>L’esempio di <a href=\"https://meda.io/how-to-make-atomic-literature-notes/\">Martin Adams</a> è molto interessante e <a href=\"https://maggieappleton.com/evergreens\">Maggie Appleton</a> ha illustrato alla perfezione i concetti.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<h3>I vantaggi</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>In queste parole di Sönke Ahrens c’è tutto:</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote><p>«Senza un serbatoio permanente di idee, non sarai in grado di sviluppare concetti importanti per un lungo periodo di tempo perché ti stai limitando alla lunghezza di un singolo progetto o alla capacità della tua memoria. Ma questo non basta per avere idee eccezionali.»</p></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>Il problema di non avere un aiuto esterno alla mente – un deposito di conoscenza – è ripreso anche da Bryan Lee:</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote><p>«Se dovessimo utilizzare un computer che costantemente perde il 90% di tutto ciò che salviamo, potrebbe funzionare solo con 5-7 informazioni alla volta prima che ogni nuovo pezzo sovrascriva una parte esistente. Non potremmo mai affrontare problemi complessi su una macchina del genere, eppure è ciò che la maggior parte delle persone cerca di fare basandosi esclusivamente sui propri pensieri interni. Le nostre menti sono piuttosto terribili nell’archiviazione a lungo termine delle informazioni e altrettanto pessime nell’archiviazione a breve termine. La scrittura ti aiuta a pensare in un modo che nessun altro mezzo può fare perché una volta che hai esternato i tuoi pensieri per iscritto, puoi iniziare a modificarli, perfezionarli, copiarli, espanderli e riordinarli.»</p></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>L’attività di prendere note ha gli stessi vantaggi dell’interesse composto. Esattamente come ha descritto Richard Hamming:</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote><p>«Conoscenza e produttività sono come l’interesse composto. Più sai, più impari; più impari, più puoi fare; più puoi fare, maggiore è l’opportunità.

        "text": "In linea generale si tratta di approcci da seguire per scrivere note, appunti e idee con il fine di prenderci cura della nostra conoscenza personale.\n\n\n\nOggi ci focalizziamo su quella che è una Atomic Note – una delle caratteristiche delle Evergreen Note – intesa come l’unità più piccola di un concetto che non può essere ulteriormente diviso.\n\n\n\nAlcune caratteristiche\n\n\n\nogni nota è un singolo nodo a cui è possibile fare riferimento, è indipendente e può essere compresa senza ricorrere ad altre note;\nogni idea favorisce il riutilizzo e la creazione di collegamenti;\nè più semplice trovare e stabilire relazioni tra le note;\nci protegge dal consumo eccessivo di contenuti;\nsi allena il pensiero attraverso la scrittura;\nè in continua evoluzione, collegamento dopo collegamento;\nè richiesto un maggiore impegno nella comprensione che ci allontana dall’accumulazione eccessiva;\nci allontana dalle strutture gerarchiche;\nle idee migliori sono una combinazione di ciò che ci succede nella vita, di ciò che fa parte del nutrimento della nostra mente.\nL’origine del principio di atomicità\n\n\n\nTra le prime persone che hanno descritto le Atomic Note e anche le Evergreen Note troviamo Andy Matuschak e Christian Tietze.\n\n\n\nIl concetto si collega al sistema di Niklas Luhmann chiamato Zettelkasten e al concetto informatico di Separation of Concerns, che, in breve, significa segmentare un programma in sezioni distinte dove ogni sezione affronta un problema separato (l’arte di segmentare e di scomporre la ritroviamo anche nei progetti, nella gestione del tempo e nelle note).\n\n\n\nI termini collegati\n\n\n\nBOAT: Block of Atomic Thought (la nota grezza e ancora acerba, che non è pronta per diventare una Evergreen Note).\n\n\n\nPermanent Note o Literature Note: sono le note rielaborate con le nostre parole (è il momento in cui prendiamo le note grezze e scriviamo le nostre considerazioni).\n\n\n\nL’esempio di Martin Adams è molto interessante e Maggie Appleton ha illustrato alla perfezione i concetti.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI vantaggi\n\n\n\nIn queste parole di Sönke Ahrens c’è tutto:\n\n\n\n«Senza un serbatoio permanente di idee, non sarai in grado di sviluppare concetti importanti per un lungo periodo di tempo perché ti stai limitando alla lunghezza di un singolo progetto o alla capacità della tua memoria. Ma questo non basta per avere idee eccezionali.»\n\n\n\nIl problema di non avere un aiuto esterno alla mente – un deposito di conoscenza – è ripreso anche da Bryan Lee:\n\n\n\n«Se dovessimo utilizzare un computer che costantemente perde il 90% di tutto ciò che salviamo, potrebbe funzionare solo con 5-7 informazioni alla volta prima che ogni nuovo pezzo sovrascriva una parte esistente. Non potremmo mai affrontare problemi complessi su una macchina del genere, eppure è ciò che la maggior parte delle persone cerca di fare basandosi esclusivamente sui propri pensieri interni. Le nostre menti sono piuttosto terribili nell’archiviazione a lungo termine delle informazioni e altrettanto pessime nell’archiviazione a breve termine. La scrittura ti aiuta a pensare in un modo che nessun altro mezzo può fare perché una volta che hai esternato i tuoi pensieri per iscritto, puoi iniziare a modificarli, perfezionarli, copiarli, espanderli e riordinarli.»\n\n\n\nL’attività di prendere note ha gli stessi vantaggi dell’interesse composto. Esattamente come ha descritto Richard Hamming:\n\n\n\n«Conoscenza e produttività sono come l’interesse composto. Più sai, più impari; più impari, più puoi fare; più puoi fare, maggiore è l’opportunità. Date due persone con esattamente le stesse capacità, l’unica persona che riesce, giorno dopo giorno, a dedicare un’ora in più a pensare sarà tremendamente più produttiva nel corso della vita.»\n\n\n\nPurtroppo non prendiamo molto seriamente il lavoro che si può fare sulla nostra conoscenza, ma una piccola nota presa con costanza può creare un impatto enorme nelle nostra vite. \n\n\n\nGuardate questo video e immaginate che il pezzo più piccolo del domino sia una nota atomica:\n\n\n\n\n\nP.S.: non conservate idee o informazioni su cose che sapete già. Le note vi devono sorprendere.\n\n\n\nP.P.S.: salvate un contenuto e riguardatelo in un secondo momento per scoprire se vi piace ancora e se merita la vostra attenzione.\n\n\n\nP.P.P.S.: costruite un flusso di gestione delle informazioni che sia il più semplice possibile per voi.\n\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tShare\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tShare\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tShare\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tTweet\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tShare"

        "text": "In linea generale si tratta di approcci da seguire per scrivere note, appunti e idee con il fine di prenderci cura della nostra conoscenza personale.\n\n\n\nOggi ci focalizziamo su quella che è una Atomic Note – una delle caratteristiche delle Evergreen Note – intesa come l’unità più piccola di un concetto che non può essere ulteriormente diviso.\n\n\n\nAlcune caratteristiche\n\n\n\nogni nota è un singolo nodo a cui è possibile fare riferimento, è indipendente e può essere compresa senza ricorrere ad altre note;\nogni idea favorisce il riutilizzo e la creazione di collegamenti;\nè più semplice trovare e stabilire relazioni tra le note;\nci protegge dal consumo eccessivo di contenuti;\nsi allena il pensiero attraverso la scrittura;\nè in continua evoluzione, collegamento dopo collegamento;\nè richiesto un maggiore impegno nella comprensione che ci allontana dall’accumulazione eccessiva;\nci allontana dalle strutture gerarchiche;\nle idee migliori sono una combinazione di ciò che ci succede nella vita, di ciò che fa parte del nutrimento della nostra mente.\nL’origine del principio di atomicità\n\n\n\nTra le prime persone che hanno descritto le Atomic Note e anche le Evergreen Note troviamo Andy Matuschak e Christian Tietze.\n\n\n\nIl concetto si collega al sistema di Niklas Luhmann chiamato Zettelkasten e al concetto informatico di Separation of Concerns, che, in breve, significa segmentare un programma in sezioni distinte dove ogni sezione affronta un problema separato (l’arte di segmentare e di scomporre la ritroviamo anche nei progetti, nella gestione del tempo e nelle note).\n\n\n\nI termini collegati\n\n\n\nBOAT: Block of Atomic Thought (la nota grezza e ancora acerba, che non è pronta per diventare una Evergreen Note).\n\n\n\nPermanent Note o Literature Note: sono le note rielaborate con le nostre parole (è il momento in cui prendiamo le note grezze e scriviamo le nostre considerazioni).\n\n\n\nL’esempio di Martin Adams è molto interessante e Maggie Appleton ha illustrato alla perfezione i concetti.\n\n\n\nI vantaggi\n\n\n\nIn queste parole di Sönke Ahrens c’è tutto:\n\n\n\n«Senza un serbatoio permanente di idee, non sarai in grado di sviluppare concetti importanti per un lungo periodo di tempo perché ti stai limitando alla lunghezza di un singolo progetto o alla capacità della tua memoria. Ma questo non basta per avere idee eccezionali.»\n\n\n\nIl problema di non avere un aiuto esterno alla mente – un deposito di conoscenza – è ripreso anche da Bryan Lee:\n\n\n\n«Se dovessimo utilizzare un computer che costantemente perde il 90% di tutto ciò che salviamo, potrebbe funzionare solo con 5-7 informazioni alla volta prima che ogni nuovo pezzo sovrascriva una parte esistente. Non potremmo mai affrontare problemi complessi su una macchina del genere, eppure è ciò che la maggior parte delle persone cerca di fare basandosi esclusivamente sui propri pensieri interni. Le nostre menti sono piuttosto terribili nell’archiviazione a lungo termine delle informazioni e altrettanto pessime nell’archiviazione a breve termine. La scrittura ti aiuta a pensare in un modo che nessun altro mezzo può fare perché una volta che hai esternato i tuoi pensieri per iscritto, puoi iniziare a modificarli, perfezionarli, copiarli, espanderli e riordinarli.»\n\n\n\nL’attività di prendere note ha gli stessi vantaggi dell’interesse composto. Esattamente come ha descritto Richard Hamming:\n\n\n\n«Conoscenza e produttività sono come l’interesse composto. Più sai, più impari; più impari, più puoi fare; più puoi fare, maggiore è l’opportunità. Date due persone con esattamente le stesse capacità, l’unica persona che riesce, giorno dopo giorno, a dedicare un’ora in più a pensare sarà tremendamente più produttiva nel corso della vita.»\n\n\n\nPurtroppo non prendiamo molto seriamente il lavoro che si può fare sulla nostra conoscenza, ma una piccola nota presa con costanza può creare un impatto enorme nelle nostra vite. \n\n\n\nGuardate questo video e immaginate che il pezzo più piccolo del domino sia una nota atomica:\n\n\n\n\n\nP.S.: non conservate idee o informazioni su cose che sapete già. Le note vi devono sorprendere.\n\n\n\nP.P.S.: salvate un contenuto e riguardatelo in un secondo momento per scoprire se vi piace ancora e se merita la vostra attenzione.\n\n\n\nP.P.P.S.: costruite un flusso di gestione delle informazioni che sia il più semplice possibile per voi.\n\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tShare\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tShare\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tShare\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tTweet\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tShare"

        "html": "<blockquote><p>\nOne thing expected from the note-taking tools, makes me particularly skeptical: their collaborative/ public use. I think the lifecycle of notes cannot be continuous from capturing to communication, unless I forgo the possibility of cryptic, sloppy, abbreviated shorthand meant just for the “me later” that Magdalena Böttger depicted so aptly in 2005. <a title=\"click to see this annotation in situ\" href=\"https://hyp.is/9TEx7t5-Eeu_wi9b0R2nPw\">❧</a>\n</p></blockquote>\n<p>Some of the value of notes being done and readable in public means that one typically puts a bit more effort into them at the start. This can make them much more useful and valuable later on. It also means that they usually have more substance and context for use by others in collaboration or other reuses.</p>\n<p>Short notes are often called fleeting notes which may or may not be processed into something more substantive. The ones that do become more substantive can more easily be reused in other future settings.</p>\n<p>Sonke Ahrens’ book <em><a href=\"https://amzn.to/3qPiXaE\">How to Take Smart Notes</a></em> is one of the better arguments for the why and how of note taking.<br />Annotated on July 06, 2021 at 10:24AM</p>\n<blockquote><p>\nNote that such careful treatment applies only to a certain kind of my notes. While many project-related notes go straight to simple folders of the operating system, the notes that don’t fit in one of the folders, deserve special attention. I don’t know yet where I might deploy them — possibly in multiple places. <a title=\"click to see this annotation in situ\" href=\"https://hyp.is/MIW90t5_EeuvSRf5Mulxag\">❧</a>\n</p></blockquote>\n<p>I like that you’ve got such a fascinating system. It’s very similar in form and substance to one that I use, but which relies on a wholly different technology stack: <a href=\"https://boffosocko.com/2020/08/29/a-note-taking-problem-and-a-proposed-solution/\">https://boffosocko.com/2020/08/29/a-note-taking-problem-and-a-proposed-solution/</a><br />Annotated on July 06, 2021 at 10:25AM</p>\n<blockquote><p>\nWhich makes them similar to “commonplace”: reusable in many places. But this connotation has led to a pejorative flavor of the German translation “Gemeinplatz” which means platitude. That’s why I prefer to call them ‘evergreen’ notes, although I am not sure if I am using this differentiation correctly. <a title=\"click to see this annotation in situ\" href=\"https://hyp.is/xQun4N6AEeusg8eM91dXoQ\">❧</a>\n</p></blockquote>\n<p>I’ve only run across the German “Gemeinplatz” a few times with this translation attached. Sad to think that this negative connotation has apparently taken hold. Even in English the word commonplace can have a somewhat negative connotation as well meaning “everyday, ordinary, unexceptional” when the point of commonplacing notes is specifically because they are surprising or extraordinary by definition.</p>\n<p>Your phrasing of “evergreen notes” seems close enough. I’ve seen some who might call the shorter notes you’re making either “seedlings” or “budding” notes. Some may wait for bigger expansions of their ideas into 500-2000 word essays before they consider them “evergreen” notes.

        "text": "One thing expected from the note-taking tools, makes me particularly skeptical: their collaborative/ public use. I think the lifecycle of notes cannot be continuous from capturing to communication, unless I forgo the possibility of cryptic, sloppy, abbreviated shorthand meant just for the “me later” that Magdalena Böttger depicted so aptly in 2005. ❧\n\nSome of the value of notes being done and readable in public means that one typically puts a bit more effort into them at the start. This can make them much more useful and valuable later on. It also means that they usually have more substance and context for use by others in collaboration or other reuses.\nShort notes are often called fleeting notes which may or may not be processed into something more substantive. The ones that do become more substantive can more easily be reused in other future settings.\nSonke Ahrens’ book How to Take Smart Notes is one of the better arguments for the why and how of note taking.\nAnnotated on July 06, 2021 at 10:24AM\n\nNote that such careful treatment applies only to a certain kind of my notes. While many project-related notes go straight to simple folders of the operating system, the notes that don’t fit in one of the folders, deserve special attention. I don’t know yet where I might deploy them — possibly in multiple places. ❧\n\nI like that you’ve got such a fascinating system. It’s very similar in form and substance to one that I use, but which relies on a wholly different technology stack: https://boffosocko.com/2020/08/29/a-note-taking-problem-and-a-proposed-solution/\nAnnotated on July 06, 2021 at 10:25AM\n\nWhich makes them similar to “commonplace”: reusable in many places. But this connotation has led to a pejorative flavor of the German translation “Gemeinplatz” which means platitude. That’s why I prefer to call them ‘evergreen’ notes, although I am not sure if I am using this differentiation correctly. ❧\n\nI’ve only run across the German “Gemeinplatz” a few times with this translation attached. Sad to think that this negative connotation has apparently taken hold. Even in English the word commonplace can have a somewhat negative connotation as well meaning “everyday, ordinary, unexceptional” when the point of commonplacing notes is specifically because they are surprising or extraordinary by definition.\nYour phrasing of “evergreen notes” seems close enough. I’ve seen some who might call the shorter notes you’re making either “seedlings” or “budding” notes. Some may wait for bigger expansions of their ideas into 500-2000 word essays before they consider them “evergreen” notes. (Compare: https://maggieappleton.com/garden-history and https://notes.andymatuschak.org/Evergreen_notes). Of course this does vary quite a bit from person to person in my experience, so your phrasing certainly fits.\nI’ve not seen it crop up in the digital gardens or zettelkasten circles specifically but the word “evergreen” is used in the journalism space to describe a fully formed article that can be re-used wholesale on a recurring basis.

      "content": {
        "html": "<p>The best change I’ve made to my life this year – and maybe in the past 10 years – is creating my own ‘Second Brain’. The Second Brain is an idea popularised by productivity guru <a href=\"https://fortelabs.co/\">Tiago Forte</a>, and is a system for personal knowledge management that exists outside of your own head.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>At its most basic, it just means taking digital notes on things. But at its best, it can help you remember everything you ever learn, and use that knowledge to transform your life.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The reason to build a system of digital notes is that we all consume tonnes of information, but don’t make the most of it. Many of us spend hours each week watching, listening and reading informational content, but how much of that do we actually absorb? If we spent just a few minutes making notes for every hour we consume content, we’d take in much more – and get much smarter in the process.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>A Second Brain is unlimited</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Our brains can only store a handful of ideas at any one time. But using technology, we can keep all the advice, insights, and inspiration we’ve collected. It’s like building an extension to your own memory. Not only does it mean you keep the wisdom you’ve accumulated over time, but it frees up your own brain for having ideas, rather than storing them.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Forte has a whole <a href=\"https://www.buildingasecondbrain.com/\">course</a> (starting at $1500!) on how to build your own Second Brain, but here I will distil the key elements so you can start to build your own for free.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For full disclosure, I haven’t yet taken the Second Brain course (the price tag is a little off-putting), but I’ve consumed tonnes of material elsewhere<span></span><span><a href=\"https://effectiveliving.co/the-basics-of-a-second-brain/#easy-footnote-bottom-1-718\" title=\". Forte himself admits that most of the course material is available online for free. The advantage of the course is doing it with a cohort and being able to get feedback from coaches.\">1</a></span>. I’ve also been working with my own Second Brain for six months. I’m already seeing huge value from it, and want to share that value with you.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>The four key elements of your Second Brain</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>Capture</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>There are whole communities of people dedicated to finding the best way to set up a Second Brain, but it doesn’t need to be complicated. The most fundamental part is ‘Capture’. This just means having a system for making notes, wherever you consume content. If you at least do this step, you’ll probably be getting more value from the content you consume than 80% of people.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The most important thing to remember with Capture is that you need to make your notes understandable to your future self. You might only come back to that note in a year’s time, and if it doesn’t make sense to you then, you’ve lost that knowledge. So you need to add a bit of context that will make the note make sense, as well as linking to the original source where possible.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I use <a href=\"https://www.notion.so/\">Notion</a> for my digital notes, but there are tonnes of other apps, including Evernote, Roam, OneNote and Apple Notes. Choosing an app can be difficult, as there are lots of factors to consider, but it’s important to remember that the one you choose now doesn’t have to be the one you use forever. I recently imported my Evernotes into Notion, and the software did it for me in minutes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I still make some notes in other programmes, such as on my Kindle, on my laptop hard drive, and in my <a href=\"https://effectiveliving.co/how-read-it-later-apps-help-you-consume-better-content/\">Read It Later app</a>. Ultimately these all end up in Notion, so that I only have to search in one place when I want to find something. There are ways of automating the transfer of these notes to speed up the process.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>Organise</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Once you’ve got a load of notes, you need some sort of system for organising them. But the great benefit of digital notes is that you can text search them. So organising isn’t that important – and spending too much time on it is counter-productive.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Forte teaches the <a href=\"https://fortelabs.co/blog/para/\">PARA</a> system of organisation, and I can’t find fault with it. You have only four top level folders: Projects, Areas, Resources, and Archives. You can have sub-folders, but at its most basic, all your notes go into one of those four. I’ve previously written about how freeing it is to have an <a href=\"https://effectiveliving.co/how-to-use-the-archive-folder/\">archive folder</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4>Projects v Areas v Resources v Archives</h4>\n\n\n\n<p>The somewhat tricky bit is deciding what is a project versus an area, versus a resource. Forte’s definitions are as follows:</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Project – a series of tasks linked to a goal, with a deadline</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Area – a sphere of activity with a standard to </strong><strong>be maintained</strong><strong> over time</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Resource – a topic or theme of ongoing interest</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Archive – inactive items from the other three categories</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>For some examples, my own projects include writing this article, and the plans for three months of travel I’m about to start. My areas include ‘Finances’, ‘Health &amp; Fitness’, and ‘Social Life’. Resources include ‘Philosophy’ and ‘Habit Formation’ and ‘TV shows to watch’. These topics often have many notes within them, and grow over time, but others consist of a single note. There are no hard and fast rules – it’s about what works for you.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A notes app that lets you create links between your notes, and which then show those links on the second note (known as bi-directional linking) is helpful for organising. This feature – which is available in Notion and Roam – mirrors how the brain works. It’s great for using the notes to create things like articles, but also helps with your own comprehension.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>Distil</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Distilling your notes means reducing them to the key elements. This helps in two ways: the act of distilling your notes enhances your comprehension of the material; and it improves the resource for when you need to quickly re-read and understand.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Mindlessly copying bits of reading material, or making tonnes of notes won’t make you understand that information. And if you have to search through thousands of words to get the gist of a note, that’s much less valuable than being able to glance at a few bullet points. Going through the distillation process increases the value of your notes many times over.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Forte has a technique for distilling notes called <a href=\"https://fortelabs.co/blog/progressive-summarization-a-practical-technique-for-designing-discoverable-notes/\">Progressive Summarisation</a>.

        "text": "The best change I’ve made to my life this year – and maybe in the past 10 years – is creating my own ‘Second Brain’. The Second Brain is an idea popularised by productivity guru Tiago Forte, and is a system for personal knowledge management that exists outside of your own head.\n\n\n\nAt its most basic, it just means taking digital notes on things. But at its best, it can help you remember everything you ever learn, and use that knowledge to transform your life.\n\n\n\nThe reason to build a system of digital notes is that we all consume tonnes of information, but don’t make the most of it. Many of us spend hours each week watching, listening and reading informational content, but how much of that do we actually absorb? If we spent just a few minutes making notes for every hour we consume content, we’d take in much more – and get much smarter in the process.\n\n\n\nA Second Brain is unlimited\n\n\n\nOur brains can only store a handful of ideas at any one time. But using technology, we can keep all the advice, insights, and inspiration we’ve collected. It’s like building an extension to your own memory. Not only does it mean you keep the wisdom you’ve accumulated over time, but it frees up your own brain for having ideas, rather than storing them.\n\n\n\nForte has a whole course (starting at $1500!) on how to build your own Second Brain, but here I will distil the key elements so you can start to build your own for free.\n\n\n\nFor full disclosure, I haven’t yet taken the Second Brain course (the price tag is a little off-putting), but I’ve consumed tonnes of material elsewhere1. I’ve also been working with my own Second Brain for six months. I’m already seeing huge value from it, and want to share that value with you.\n\n\n\nThe four key elements of your Second Brain\n\n\n\nCapture\n\n\n\nThere are whole communities of people dedicated to finding the best way to set up a Second Brain, but it doesn’t need to be complicated. The most fundamental part is ‘Capture’. This just means having a system for making notes, wherever you consume content. If you at least do this step, you’ll probably be getting more value from the content you consume than 80% of people.\n\n\n\nThe most important thing to remember with Capture is that you need to make your notes understandable to your future self. You might only come back to that note in a year’s time, and if it doesn’t make sense to you then, you’ve lost that knowledge. So you need to add a bit of context that will make the note make sense, as well as linking to the original source where possible.\n\n\n\nI use Notion for my digital notes, but there are tonnes of other apps, including Evernote, Roam, OneNote and Apple Notes. Choosing an app can be difficult, as there are lots of factors to consider, but it’s important to remember that the one you choose now doesn’t have to be the one you use forever. I recently imported my Evernotes into Notion, and the software did it for me in minutes.\n\n\n\nI still make some notes in other programmes, such as on my Kindle, on my laptop hard drive, and in my Read It Later app. Ultimately these all end up in Notion, so that I only have to search in one place when I want to find something. There are ways of automating the transfer of these notes to speed up the process.\n\n\n\nOrganise\n\n\n\nOnce you’ve got a load of notes, you need some sort of system for organising them. But the great benefit of digital notes is that you can text search them. So organising isn’t that important – and spending too much time on it is counter-productive.\n\n\n\nForte teaches the PARA system of organisation, and I can’t find fault with it. You have only four top level folders: Projects, Areas, Resources, and Archives. You can have sub-folders, but at its most basic, all your notes go into one of those four. I’ve previously written about how freeing it is to have an archive folder.\n\n\n\nProjects v Areas v Resources v Archives\n\n\n\nThe somewhat tricky bit is deciding what is a project versus an area, versus a resource. Forte’s definitions are as follows:\n\n\n\nProject – a series of tasks linked to a goal, with a deadline\n\n\n\nArea – a sphere of activity with a standard to be maintained over time\n\n\n\nResource – a topic or theme of ongoing interest\n\n\n\nArchive – inactive items from the other three categories\n\n\n\nFor some examples, my own projects include writing this article, and the plans for three months of travel I’m about to start. My areas include ‘Finances’, ‘Health & Fitness’, and ‘Social Life’. Resources include ‘Philosophy’ and ‘Habit Formation’ and ‘TV shows to watch’. These topics often have many notes within them, and grow over time, but others consist of a single note. There are no hard and fast rules – it’s about what works for you.\n\n\n\nA notes app that lets you create links between your notes, and which then show those links on the second note (known as bi-directional linking) is helpful for organising. This feature – which is available in Notion and Roam – mirrors how the brain works. It’s great for using the notes to create things like articles, but also helps with your own comprehension.\n\n\n\nDistil\n\n\n\nDistilling your notes means reducing them to the key elements. This helps in two ways: the act of distilling your notes enhances your comprehension of the material; and it improves the resource for when you need to quickly re-read and understand.\n\n\n\nMindlessly copying bits of reading material, or making tonnes of notes won’t make you understand that information. And if you have to search through thousands of words to get the gist of a note, that’s much less valuable than being able to glance at a few bullet points. Going through the distillation process increases the value of your notes many times over.\n\n\n\nForte has a technique for distilling notes called Progressive Summarisation. It basically means going through and bolding interesting things. You then go through again and highlight the best of the bolded bits. Finally you make a few summary notes – in your own words – at the top of the note. Simple, yet effective.\n\n\n\nExpress\n\n\n\nThis step’s optional, but it helps your understanding if you turn your notes into something of your own. That could be an article like this one, a podcast, a drawing, or just having a conversation with someone about the topic.\n\n\n\nThe idea behind this step is that it forces you into using a version of The Feynman Technique for learning. The best way to know if you’ve understood a topic is to try to teach it to someone else. And if it doesn’t make sense to that other person, you can improve on it till it does.\n\n\n\nThis step is the very essence of creativity. No one ever comes up with something completely from scratch, but we recycle and remix others’ ideas into something new2. Of course, you get bonus points if you integrate concepts from other notes. The combination of multiple ideas is what we call originality.\n\n\n\nI’ll be writing a lot more on the details of how to build your Second Brain, as it’s such an important topic. I also recommend you check out Tiago Forte’s Building A Second Brain podcast, which you can access through the usual podcast apps. There’s also a wonderful visualisation of the key elements of building a Second Brain on the Maggie Appleton blog.\n\n\n\nAnd if you only take away one thing from this article, start collecting digital notes on things now. I wish I’d done it much sooner.\nFootnotes\n. Forte himself admits that most of the course material is available online for free. The advantage of the course is doing it with a cohort and being able to get feedback from coaches.\n\n\nGiving proper credit where it’s due, of course."

But by the time you get to 80 years after his death, he’s fading. So much new stuff comes along, some of the old just has to get displaced.”</p>\n\n  <p>Whether such a fate awaits pop stars in an era of Spotify remains to be seen. But as Dibdin proves, fame can be a fickle mistress – and there’s no guarantee that being the most popular figure in one era means you’ll be remembered in another.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>It’s an interesting idea: that an person’s public memory is maintained only so long as people alive remember them. At 80 years after death most people who ever intersected with Dibdin’s living years would have passed. And it raises a question of:</p>\n<ul><li>how true is it over time?</li>\n  <li>how true is it with ideas as opposed to just people?</li>\n</ul><p>The question of <strong>Does this hold true over time?</strong> comes down to the advent of recorded music and even beyond that: streaming, torrents, CDs, and mp3 files. Dibdin rose to fame in part by selling his sheet music: a way to get his work into as many households, taverns, libraries, etc that he could. While we no longer have his full works (which is concerning given the proliferation of it), we do still have some of his sheet music. By comparison, today your media is shareable by default. And the Library of Congress preserves as much as they can. Will people still listen to the Beatles in 50 years? At least if they want to, they’re likely to have recordings of it. Will that elongate the life of these artists, or does taste change so significantly over time that it doesn’t matter? No song in the <a href=\"https://playback.fm/charts/top-100-songs/1900\">1900s top charts</a> will feel like a bop today.</p>\n\n<p>The second question is: <strong>are ideas <em>also</em> most strongly held in the 80 years after a collective experience?</strong> Take the reconsideration of communism among the American public. When did the American public last have a collective conversation about communism? 60-70 years ago? We often say history rhymes, is it because we <em>must</em> reassess the previous generation’s conclusions for ourselves?</p>\n\n<p>It’s a nebulous idea because it’s hard to prove: there are many different pieces here. Holocaust denial having a resurgence almost 80 years after the Holocaust could be related to this idea. Or we could be more susceptible to conspiracy theories due to the way we use social media to mirror our ideas back to us. There’s no end to denial-based conspiracy theories from all eras (moon landing, Sandy Hook, etc).</p>\n\n<p>The 80 year boundary could also only really apply to people. Ideas are completely different from people and there <em>are</em> ideas that have thrived in support well past the 80 year boundary (e.g. Democracy). Every generation can have an equally real interaction with an idea. I can have a relationship with Democracy that is just as deep as my great great grandparents. People, however, die and your tie to them will rarely be as strong as those who loved them in person. I cannot have the same relationship with Dr. Martin Luther King Jr, for example, as people who walked with him in Selma. I instead have a relationship with his memory, ideas and narratives.</p>\n\n<p>In the end, this 80 year mark in the life of Charles Dibdin may have importance only in the life of Charles Dibdin. But there must be a relationship between the human lifespan of roughly 80 years and 80 years marking the decline of Dibdin’s cultural prominence.

        "html": "This content is 1 year old. Remember that the following content might be outdated.<p>This article is a bit tricky, yet is going to be super useful to anyone with a blog. Or anyone using images in their communication, conference slides, etc. It will help you if you ever find yourself facing stuff like this: “<em>Ugh, I am so tired of seeing the same boring stock photos on every blog…but then…every visual I pick is also the same exact type of thing that I am tired of seeing. Maybe, if I take this and just move on pixel to the left, people won’t be able to tell I stole the design, branding, visual style?</em>”. Yes, we can tell. </p>\n<p>From <strong>photos</strong>, to <strong>illustrations</strong>, <strong>mosaics</strong> and <strong>abstract patterns</strong>: how could you make your blog headers, images and other visual content part of your brand identity? Here’s some <strong>real world advice</strong> from an experienced designer on how to be your best visual self online, with actual examples.</p>\n<h2>Rethinking the classic “let’s use a stock photo”</h2>\n<p>Let’s start with the basics. You could use images, as in “a stock photos” to illustrate your articles. I’m talking about the “blog header image” here. But this also applies if you want images inside the article. Usually as decoration or “breathing” areas.</p>\n<p>Almost all the blogs (mine included) use that technique. You can use:</p>\n<ul><li>use photos on the topic of the article: simple, efficient</li>\n<li>mix the image(s) with some text overlay something like <a href=\"https://www.webdesignertrends.com/2020/12/ui-ux-incontournables-webdesign-inspi/\">Webdesigner Trends</a>.</li>\n</ul><p>You can create those overlays in design tools. If you do so and have text in your images, don’t forget about alternative attributes on the image if the title is not in the HTML elsewhere. Because, accessibility. You can also achieve<a href=\"https://ishadeed.com/article/handling-text-over-image-css/\"> the overlays with pure CSS</a>. There’s nice techniques in this article “<a href=\"https://www.canva.com/learn/transparent-background/\">How to effectively use transparent backgrounds in graphic design</a>” if you want to start playing with image overlays and transparency. Again, be careful about accessibility though!! You need your text to have enough contrast ratio to read it on top of images.</p>\n\n<img src=\"https://stephaniewalter.design/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/stock-photos-galleries.jpg\" alt=\"mosaic of different stock photo galleries\" width=\"1200\" height=\"480\" />\n\n<h3>Some places to find nice images</h3>\n<p>Finding the right image is always tricky. How And at some point, everyone ends up with the same boring stock photos. So here are a few place to find nice images, that hopefully go beyond what you see everywhere.</p>\n<ul><li>Let’s start with the classic: <a href=\"https://unsplash.com/\"><strong>unsplash.com</strong></a>. One thing I like about unsplash is the <a href=\"https://unsplash.com/s/photos/unporn\">unporn</a> series: a nice place to find pictures if you need to write about nsfw topics (like sexual health).</li>\n<li>Another idea if you can’t find images linked to your theme or topic, is to go full <strong>abstract</strong>. Repeating patterns and geometric images work nicely, and <a href=\"https://unsplash.com/s/photos/geometric-pattern\">there’s a lot on unsplash</a>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"https://nappy.co/\"><strong>Nappy.co</strong></a> provides, I quote, “beautiful photos of Black and Brown people”, for free.</li>\n<li>Diversity in skin tones and on the gender spectrum is important, but so is <strong>diversity in different body types</strong>, abled and not. <a href=\"https://affecttheverb.com/collection/\">Disabled And Here</a> is a disability-led stock image and interview series celebrating disabled Black, Indigenous, people of color (BIPOC).</li>\n<li>If, like me, you are tired of always seeing the same type of people (cis gender conforming people) in images on blog posts, give <a href=\"https://genderphotos.vice.com/\">The Gender Spectrum Collection: Stock Photos Beyond the Binary</a> a try.</li>\n<li>Life is messy, unfiltered. Polished stock photos are nice, yet, soooo boring. If you are tired of boring perfection, this is <a href=\"https://www.stocksy.com/\">Stocksy.com</a>’s promise: Stock Photos and Footage with <strong>no filler </strong>\n</li>\n<li>Now, if you want to bring it next level and have specific needs, icon8 has this tool called <a href=\"https://icons8.com/photos?ref=stephaniewalter\">Moose</a> and it lets you create your own scenes. <a href=\"https://icons8.com/creator/template/5d0d2773f0fed7001f121007?ref=stephaniewalter\">Need a giant dog in the living room with a guy eating salad? Yup, they got you covered</a>\n</li>\n<li>Also, this <a href=\"https://www.myriamjessier.com/blog/best-list-of-free-stock-photo-images-for-commercial-use/\">list of free stock photo images for commercial use</a> is a nice recap.</li>\n</ul><h2>Spicing up boring stock photos</h2>\n<p></p><img src=\"https://stephaniewalter.design/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/images-colors.jpg\" alt=\"Visual examples of the technics described above\" width=\"1200\" height=\"477\" />\n<p>Okay you might say “yes but if everyone is using images, how might I spice things up and make those unique”.</p>\n<p>There’s a few things you could do:</p>\n<ul><li>Have some <strong>colored overlay</strong> on top of your images <a href=\"https://matthiasott.com/articles/going-indie-reclaiming-content\">just like Matthias does here</a>. Bonus if it matches your brand identity. You can see  this in action on “<a href=\"https://stephaniewalter.design/blog/how-can-i-find-my-first-ux-job/\">How can I find my first ux job</a>” and “<a href=\"https://stephaniewalter.design/blog/80-ux-blogs-with-rss-feed-to-follow/\">80+ UX blogs (with RSS feed) to follow</a>”. I am in both using a stock photo, and applied a purple filter.</li>\n<li>This trick also works with <strong>gradients</strong>. CSS Tricks mixes a lot of different image techniques. But every image has this orange purple blue gradient on top of them to give them some consistency and <a href=\"https://css-tricks.com/archives/\">make it look nice on the homepage</a>\n</li>\n<li>You could also decide you want them all to be <strong>black and white </strong><a href=\"https://henry.codes/writing\">like Henry Desroches’s website</a>\n</li>\n<li>Or you could do like my friend Myriam: she once decided she would give a talk with <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/10s5Vz6Y2FoACBds1LtuRnxRA6UnfLhz2LKq_gp1JDm4/edit?usp=sharing\">only pink images</a>. And it was awesome and it worked. The images had little to nothing to do with the talk. But, it worked. Because, there was <strong>consistency</strong> and a theme.</li>\n</ul><h3>Some tools to spice up your photos</h3>\n<p></p><img src=\"https://stephaniewalter.design/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/color-image-tools.jpg\" alt=\"Screenshot of the following tools\" width=\"1080\" height=\"477\" />\n<p>Image editing can be annoying so here are some tools to help:</p>\n<ul><li>\n<a href=\"https://doodad.dev/dither-me-this/\">Dither images</a> could be your thing, there’s plenty of styles to explorer with this tool</li>\n<li>Bring back <a href=\"https://duotones.co/\">duotones images</a> back to something trendy, I dare you</li>\n<li>With <a href=\"https://www.fecolormatrix.com/\">SVG color Matrix Mixer</a> you can generator some SVG <strong>color matrix filters</strong> on top of images. This way, you don’t need design tools to color images but can apply those on your websites.</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"https://yoksel.github.io/svg-gradient-map/#/\">SVG Gradient Map Filter</a>: another tool to build some duotone on top of an image using SVG</li>\n<li>If you are into gradients you could try <a href=\"https://omatsuri.app/gradient-generator\">this</a> or <a href=\"https://omatsuri.app/gradient-generator\">this</a> and add them in CSS with some blend modes on top of your images. This means you don’t need to edit every single image, let the browser do the job.</li>\n</ul><p><em>I do most of my editing in Sketch (Photoshop if I really want something fancy) so I don’t have that many online tools. Feel free to reach out by email or twitter if you have some nice gems to share here</em>.</p>\n<h2>Bringing in some characters and illustrations</h2>\n<p></p><img src=\"https://stephaniewalter.design/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/illustrations-example.jpg\" alt=\"Screenshots of the following illustrations\" width=\"1200\" height=\"477\" />\n<p>Illustrations are super trendy. For real. They have been for a while now. They offer <strong>more flexibility</strong> than stock photos because your imagination is the limit. And you can go super abstract.</p>\n<p>Here are some cool examples if you are looking for “how do people use illustrations” inspiration:</p>\n<ul><li>\n<a href=\"https://www.viget.com/articles/\">Viget</a> is a good example of simplicity for the usage of illustrations. Each article header is one rounded illustration with a nice colorful background that depends on the category.</li>\n<li>Each article on <a href=\"https://www.cassie.codes/writing/\">Cassie Evan’s blog</a> is represented by a nice little illustration</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"https://www.sandrabydesign.com/blog\">Sandra Camacho’s insights</a> use cute branded illustrations in the preview and on the article</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"https://alistapart.com/article/human-readable-javascript/\">A List Apart</a> brings illustration to the next level, each article has a custom banner illustration. It has been this way for years now and I love it.</li>\n<li>I also love the drawing style of the illustrations on <a href=\"https://sketchplanations.com/archive\">Sketchplanations</a>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"https://www.uxpin.com/studio/blog/\">The blog of UX Pin</a> has some simple illustrations, most of the time geometric ones but it works quite well</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"https://whoisnicoleharris.com/2018/07/26/pypi-past-present-future.html\">Nicole Harris’s</a> <a href=\"https://whoisnicoleharris.com/2016/04/16/djangocon-eu-2016.html\">articles headers</a> <a href=\"https://whoisnicoleharris.com/2015/03/19/bdd-part-two.html\">are all a color</a>, <a href=\"https://whoisnicoleharris.com/2014/12/29/2014-my-year-of-python.html\">a white illustration</a>, <a href=\"https://whoisnicoleharris.com/2018/05/17/warehouse-accessibility.html\">some text,</a> that’s it. And it works nicely</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"https://maggieappleton.com/essays\">Maggie Appleton</a> uses awesome hand drawn illustrations as images to introduce her essays</li>\n<li>Another trick with images is to have images (or illustrations) on a specific theme, like  <a href=\"https://tympanus.net/codrops/collective/\">Codrops Collective</a> does.</li>\n</ul><p>And the list goes on and on.</p>\n<h3>Getting the most out of illustrations for your blog</h3>\n<p>Here’s a few illustrations tips to bring more consistency to your blog and brand:</p>\n<ul><li>\n<a href=\"https://css-tricks.com/lodge/svg/\"><strong>SVG </strong>for illustrations is awesome</a>. You can embed SVG illustrations directly on websites and it would be lighter than PNGs. The annoying part is that some CMSs like WordPress won’t let you do so by default (but there’s tricks). But if you have a custom blog, it’s worth a shot. You can also embed JavaScript so you animate those. And you can <strong>mix vector and JPG/PNG images in SVG</strong> just like <a href=\"https://www.khanacademy.org/\">Khan Academy homepage</a>. SVG is also an open door to <a href=\"https://pudding.cool/\">awesome interactive infographics</a>.</li>\n<li>Illustration authors usually have a specific “style” (or a few styles). If you need multiple illustrations, <strong>try to use illustrations from the same “pack</strong>”. This will again help bring <strong>consistency</strong>. My trick: check the profile of the authors on the different platforms and cherry pick the illustrations that go well together.</li>\n<li>Illustrations usually come in vector format like SVG, AI (for illustrator) or more versatil EPS. You can open those with vector tools (like <a href=\"https://inkscape.org/\">Inkscape</a> which is free, but also <a href=\"https://vectr.com/\">vectr.com</a> in the browser or even figma). You can <strong>change the colors of the illustrations </strong>to have them <strong>match your brand identity</strong>. Some of the galleries in the next section even come with built in tools to recolor those).</li>\n<li>If you want something specific, <strong>hire a professional illustrator</strong> (reach out in email if you need some names). Usually illustrators take commission and can create you a set of different illustrations on some themes you can reuse</li>\n</ul><p>Of course you don’t have to go one style or another. <strong>Mixing strategies</strong> based on different content types works nicely. For example <a href=\"https://uxmag.com/\">uxmag.com</a> has a mix of sometimes illustrations. So does <a href=\"https://www.thinkcompany.com/blog/\">Think Company</a>, but if you look at their illustrations, you’ll see consistency in the styles.</p>\n\n<img src=\"https://stephaniewalter.design/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/illustrations-tools.jpg\" alt=\"Screenshots of illustration galleries\" width=\"1200\" height=\"480\" />\n\n<h4>Recolor Icons and Illustrations in Illustrator</h4>\n<p></p><img src=\"https://stephaniewalter.design/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/illustrator-recolorartwork.jpg\" alt=\"Illustrator file opened with the &quot;recolor artwork&quot; example with yellow and purple colors\" width=\"1200\" height=\"521\" />\n<p>So, let’s talk about my <strong>secret weapon for illustrations</strong>. I told you in the introduction, I’m giving you all the secrets so that you can steal like an artist (also yes, check that book). For all my personal projects for example I use the <a href=\"https://streamlineicons.com/\">streamline icons and illustrations</a>. Here’s my pro tip: I use <strong>Illustrator’s “recolor artwork” </strong>tool to quickly recolor them. I can also try out different options and have them match my yellow and purple brand identity. <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJRESPUO5zw\">Here’s a video to teach you how to</a>. Another Illustrator tip: if you want to <strong>manually replace colors</strong>, you could use select &gt; same  &gt; color and fill to <strong>select everything that has the same color</strong>.</p>\n<h3>Cool places to find cool illustrations</h3>\n<ul><li>\n<a href=\"https://stubborn.fun/\">Stubborn.fun</a> is a character generator that also lets you create scenes</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"https://blush.design/\">Blush.design</a> is a figma and sketch plugin to create storytelling illustrations</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"https://weareskribbl.com/\">Weareskribbl.com</a> is a collection of free hand drawn illustrations in a “black and white line style”</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"https://www.drawkit.io/\">Drawkit.io</a> is a collection of nice illustrations updated weekly</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"https://undraw.co/\">Undraw.co</a> became one of the big classics when it comes to free minimal illustrations</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"https://freeillustrations.xyz/\">Freeillustrations.xyz</a> offers a lot of illustrations kits in different styles</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"https://www.getillustrations.com/\">getillustrations.com</a> is another nice place to find free and non free illustrations</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"https://icons8.com/illustrations?ref=stephaniewalter\">icon8</a> also has nice illustrations. Bonus point, you can recolor those in their tool directly. Worth a try.</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"https://www.blackillustrations.com/\">Blackillustrations.com</a> are beautiful illustrations of Black people for your next digital project</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"https://mixkit.co/free-stock-art/\">Mixkit.co</a> has a lot of free resources (videos, sound) and has a section dedicated to “free stock art”.</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/biodivlibrary/albums\">Biodiversity Heritage Library’s albums</a> offer images from old books, plants and animals that I love so much. I admit it’s a specific style. But it can work.</li>\n<li>Another really specific style of images can be found on <a href=\"https://www.oldbookillustrations.com/\">oldbookillustrations.com</a>. I am not sure if this goes under illustrations or images, it’s definitely a really specific style, but I kind of like it. You could have a whole series on animals, people, etc. The cool part: since it’s mostly black and white you can have a lot of fun with filters and recoloring those. This <a href=\"https://www.robinrendle.com/essays/newsletters\">awesome essay on newsletter uses that style</a>, and it works!</li>\n</ul><h2>How to “find” the right images and concepts.</h2>\n<p>Time for another secret trick: when I am looking for images (or illustrations) to illustrate a concept, I <strong>start with a </strong><a href=\"https://www.google.com/search?q=%22user+research%22&amp;tbm=isch&amp;ved=2ahUKEwi90L-s-PvvAhWchP0HHUzfAGEQ2-cCegQIABAA&amp;oq=%22user+research%22&amp;gs_lcp=CgNpbWcQAzICCAAyAggAMgIIADICCAAyAggAMgIIADICCAAyAggAMgIIADICCAA6BAgAEEM6BAgjECc6BAgAEBg6BggAEAcQHlCgJFicRWCSR2gHcAB4AIABfogBlgqSAQQyMS4xmAEAoAEBqgELZ3dzLXdpei1pbWfAAQE&amp;sclient=img&amp;ei=9u51YL39OpyJ9u8PzL6DiAY&amp;bih=1341&amp;biw=1363&amp;client=firefox-b-d\"><strong>Google image search</strong></a>. This gives me a first “trend” of <strong>what other humans expect to “see”</strong> around this topic. Another thing I love with the Google image search results is the suggestions. This helps me understand <strong>taxonomies</strong> and what humans, again, expect around this concept. This is how my SEO friend Myriam explains it:</p>\n<blockquote><p>“ Google tries here to make some human/machine translation of a concept into distinct entities, aka, build taxonomies, like, hashtags”.</p></blockquote>\n<p>And this is gold to help you find images. A lot of “image search engines” like <a href=\"https://unsplash.com/s/photos/ux-design\">unsplash</a> do this trick as well and help you expand your search.</p>\n<p></p><img src=\"https://stephaniewalter.design/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/images-tips-research.jpg\" alt=\"Google search results with some taxonomy propositions, same for unsplash with some taxonomy tags\" width=\"1200\" height=\"477\" />\n<p>I also like to take a look at what kind of images come up in <a href=\"https://thenounproject.com/search/?q=UX+design\">The Noun Project</a>. Again, the idea is to understand human mental models to illustrate concepts. Last but no least, you could take a look at “<a href=\"https://same.energy/\">Same Energy</a>”, a visual search engine.</p>\n<h2>Mandatory copyright and license warning</h2>\n<p>TLDNR: check the image/illustration <strong>license</strong>. If there’s no license, <strong>don’t re-use unless you asked for permission</strong>.</p>\n<p>I can’t write an article about images and illustrations without a warning about copyright. I’m honestly quite tired of the design community, but also of other communities giving zero toughs about copyright. So let me put this here: <strong>just because someone put an image or an illustration on a blog, it doesn’t mean you can reuse it</strong>. Especially on commercial content. <em>And yes, I’m pointing at you, agencies who use content from my blog without my permission. I see you 🙂  </em></p>\n<p>So, before using ANY image, photo, illustration: <strong>check the copyright rules</strong>. And, follow those.

        "text": "This content is 1 year old. Remember that the following content might be outdated.This article is a bit tricky, yet is going to be super useful to anyone with a blog. Or anyone using images in their communication, conference slides, etc. It will help you if you ever find yourself facing stuff like this: “Ugh, I am so tired of seeing the same boring stock photos on every blog…but then…every visual I pick is also the same exact type of thing that I am tired of seeing. Maybe, if I take this and just move on pixel to the left, people won’t be able to tell I stole the design, branding, visual style?”. Yes, we can tell. \nFrom photos, to illustrations, mosaics and abstract patterns: how could you make your blog headers, images and other visual content part of your brand identity? Here’s some real world advice from an experienced designer on how to be your best visual self online, with actual examples.\nRethinking the classic “let’s use a stock photo”\nLet’s start with the basics. You could use images, as in “a stock photos” to illustrate your articles. I’m talking about the “blog header image” here. But this also applies if you want images inside the article. Usually as decoration or “breathing” areas.\nAlmost all the blogs (mine included) use that technique. You can use:\nuse photos on the topic of the article: simple, efficient\nmix the image(s) with some text overlay something like Webdesigner Trends.\nYou can create those overlays in design tools. If you do so and have text in your images, don’t forget about alternative attributes on the image if the title is not in the HTML elsewhere. Because, accessibility. You can also achieve the overlays with pure CSS. There’s nice techniques in this article “How to effectively use transparent backgrounds in graphic design” if you want to start playing with image overlays and transparency. Again, be careful about accessibility though!! You need your text to have enough contrast ratio to read it on top of images.\n\nSome places to find nice images\nFinding the right image is always tricky. How And at some point, everyone ends up with the same boring stock photos. So here are a few place to find nice images, that hopefully go beyond what you see everywhere.\nLet’s start with the classic: unsplash.com. One thing I like about unsplash is the unporn series: a nice place to find pictures if you need to write about nsfw topics (like sexual health).\nAnother idea if you can’t find images linked to your theme or topic, is to go full abstract. Repeating patterns and geometric images work nicely, and there’s a lot on unsplash\n\n\nNappy.co provides, I quote, “beautiful photos of Black and Brown people”, for free.\nDiversity in skin tones and on the gender spectrum is important, but so is diversity in different body types, abled and not. Disabled And Here is a disability-led stock image and interview series celebrating disabled Black, Indigenous, people of color (BIPOC).\nIf, like me, you are tired of always seeing the same type of people (cis gender conforming people) in images on blog posts, give The Gender Spectrum Collection: Stock Photos Beyond the Binary a try.\nLife is messy, unfiltered. Polished stock photos are nice, yet, soooo boring. If you are tired of boring perfection, this is Stocksy.com’s promise: Stock Photos and Footage with no filler \n\nNow, if you want to bring it next level and have specific needs, icon8 has this tool called Moose and it lets you create your own scenes. Need a giant dog in the living room with a guy eating salad? Yup, they got you covered\n\nAlso, this list of free stock photo images for commercial use is a nice recap.\nSpicing up boring stock photos\nOkay you might say “yes but if everyone is using images, how might I spice things up and make those unique”.\nThere’s a few things you could do:\nHave some colored overlay on top of your images just like Matthias does here. Bonus if it matches your brand identity. You can see  this in action on “How can I find my first ux job” and “80+ UX blogs (with RSS feed) to follow”. I am in both using a stock photo, and applied a purple filter.\nThis trick also works with gradients. CSS Tricks mixes a lot of different image techniques. But every image has this orange purple blue gradient on top of them to give them some consistency and make it look nice on the homepage\n\nYou could also decide you want them all to be black and white like Henry Desroches’s website\n\nOr you could do like my friend Myriam: she once decided she would give a talk with only pink images. And it was awesome and it worked. The images had little to nothing to do with the talk. But, it worked. Because, there was consistency and a theme.\nSome tools to spice up your photos\nImage editing can be annoying so here are some tools to help:\n\nDither images could be your thing, there’s plenty of styles to explorer with this tool\nBring back duotones images back to something trendy, I dare you\nWith SVG color Matrix Mixer you can generator some SVG color matrix filters on top of images. This way, you don’t need design tools to color images but can apply those on your websites.\n\nSVG Gradient Map Filter: another tool to build some duotone on top of an image using SVG\nIf you are into gradients you could try this or this and add them in CSS with some blend modes on top of your images. This means you don’t need to edit every single image, let the browser do the job.\nI do most of my editing in Sketch (Photoshop if I really want something fancy) so I don’t have that many online tools. Feel free to reach out by email or twitter if you have some nice gems to share here.\nBringing in some characters and illustrations\nIllustrations are super trendy. For real. They have been for a while now. They offer more flexibility than stock photos because your imagination is the limit. And you can go super abstract.\nHere are some cool examples if you are looking for “how do people use illustrations” inspiration:\n\nViget is a good example of simplicity for the usage of illustrations. Each article header is one rounded illustration with a nice colorful background that depends on the category.\nEach article on Cassie Evan’s blog is represented by a nice little illustration\n\nSandra Camacho’s insights use cute branded illustrations in the preview and on the article\n\nA List Apart brings illustration to the next level, each article has a custom banner illustration. It has been this way for years now and I love it.\nI also love the drawing style of the illustrations on Sketchplanations\n\n\nThe blog of UX Pin has some simple illustrations, most of the time geometric ones but it works quite well\n\nNicole Harris’s articles headers are all a color, a white illustration, some text, that’s it. And it works nicely\n\nMaggie Appleton uses awesome hand drawn illustrations as images to introduce her essays\nAnother trick with images is to have images (or illustrations) on a specific theme, like  Codrops Collective does.\nAnd the list goes on and on.\nGetting the most out of illustrations for your blog\nHere’s a few illustrations tips to bring more consistency to your blog and brand:\n\nSVG for illustrations is awesome. You can embed SVG illustrations directly on websites and it would be lighter than PNGs. The annoying part is that some CMSs like WordPress won’t let you do so by default (but there’s tricks). But if you have a custom blog, it’s worth a shot. You can also embed JavaScript so you animate those. And you can mix vector and JPG/PNG images in SVG just like Khan Academy homepage. SVG is also an open door to awesome interactive infographics.\nIllustration authors usually have a specific “style” (or a few styles). If you need multiple illustrations, try to use illustrations from the same “pack”. This will again help bring consistency. My trick: check the profile of the authors on the different platforms and cherry pick the illustrations that go well together.\nIllustrations usually come in vector format like SVG, AI (for illustrator) or more versatil EPS. You can open those with vector tools (like Inkscape which is free, but also vectr.com in the browser or even figma). You can change the colors of the illustrations to have them match your brand identity. Some of the galleries in the next section even come with built in tools to recolor those).\nIf you want something specific, hire a professional illustrator (reach out in email if you need some names). Usually illustrators take commission and can create you a set of different illustrations on some themes you can reuse\nOf course you don’t have to go one style or another. Mixing strategies based on different content types works nicely. For example uxmag.com has a mix of sometimes illustrations. So does Think Company, but if you look at their illustrations, you’ll see consistency in the styles.\n\nRecolor Icons and Illustrations in Illustrator\nSo, let’s talk about my secret weapon for illustrations. I told you in the introduction, I’m giving you all the secrets so that you can steal like an artist (also yes, check that book). For all my personal projects for example I use the streamline icons and illustrations. Here’s my pro tip: I use Illustrator’s “recolor artwork” tool to quickly recolor them. I can also try out different options and have them match my yellow and purple brand identity. Here’s a video to teach you how to. Another Illustrator tip: if you want to manually replace colors, you could use select > same  > color and fill to select everything that has the same color.\nCool places to find cool illustrations\n\nStubborn.fun is a character generator that also lets you create scenes\n\nBlush.design is a figma and sketch plugin to create storytelling illustrations\n\nWeareskribbl.com is a collection of free hand drawn illustrations in a “black and white line style”\n\nDrawkit.io is a collection of nice illustrations updated weekly\n\nUndraw.co became one of the big classics when it comes to free minimal illustrations\n\nFreeillustrations.xyz offers a lot of illustrations kits in different styles\n\ngetillustrations.com is another nice place to find free and non free illustrations\n\nicon8 also has nice illustrations. Bonus point, you can recolor those in their tool directly. Worth a try.\n\nBlackillustrations.com are beautiful illustrations of Black people for your next digital project\n\nMixkit.co has a lot of free resources (videos, sound) and has a section dedicated to “free stock art”.\n\nBiodiversity Heritage Library’s albums offer images from old books, plants and animals that I love so much. I admit it’s a specific style. But it can work.\nAnother really specific style of images can be found on oldbookillustrations.com. I am not sure if this goes under illustrations or images, it’s definitely a really specific style, but I kind of like it. You could have a whole series on animals, people, etc. The cool part: since it’s mostly black and white you can have a lot of fun with filters and recoloring those. This awesome essay on newsletter uses that style, and it works!\nHow to “find” the right images and concepts.\nTime for another secret trick: when I am looking for images (or illustrations) to illustrate a concept, I start with a Google image search. This gives me a first “trend” of what other humans expect to “see” around this topic. Another thing I love with the Google image search results is the suggestions. This helps me understand taxonomies and what humans, again, expect around this concept. This is how my SEO friend Myriam explains it:\n“ Google tries here to make some human/machine translation of a concept into distinct entities, aka, build taxonomies, like, hashtags”.\nAnd this is gold to help you find images. A lot of “image search engines” like unsplash do this trick as well and help you expand your search.\nI also like to take a look at what kind of images come up in The Noun Project. Again, the idea is to understand human mental models to illustrate concepts. Last but no least, you could take a look at “Same Energy”, a visual search engine.\nMandatory copyright and license warning\nTLDNR: check the image/illustration license. If there’s no license, don’t re-use unless you asked for permission.\nI can’t write an article about images and illustrations without a warning about copyright. I’m honestly quite tired of the design community, but also of other communities giving zero toughs about copyright. So let me put this here: just because someone put an image or an illustration on a blog, it doesn’t mean you can reuse it. Especially on commercial content. And yes, I’m pointing at you, agencies who use content from my blog without my permission. I see you 🙂  \nSo, before using ANY image, photo, illustration: check the copyright rules. And, follow those. By default, if there’s no mention or copyright, the image belongs to the blog owner (unless they themselves stole it from somewhere). So, by default, unless it’s written otherwise, you can’t use an image from someone else.\nThe good news is that today, there’s a lot of content under creative common licenses and open licenses. You can use most of that content, even for commercial use (unless the license says otherwise). But you usually still need to credit the author somewhere.\nMosaic, grids and collages of images and photos\nI’m not going to pretend otherwise: mozaic and collages might be THE technic I use the most for my blog images. Mosaics work really nicely if, like me, you publish posts that are resources or lists of content on different topics. I did (and still do) a lot of tests and explore with the format a lot. Here are a few examples from my own experiments over the last, like, 10 years of blogging. I told you that today, I’m showing you all the tricks in my book 😉\n\n5 years ago I used to have only 2 images in the collages\nThen, about 3 or 4 years ago, I started to use more vertical images in the collage, since a lot of websites are now optimized for responsive web design. I also use this technique when I have a few nice portrait images.\n\nFor the last 6 months, I have been sharing more and more “inspiration” resources. So the vertical mosaic doesn’t always fit. I started adding some portrait and landscape images to the mix.\nDid someone say colorful collage mosaic. Here I explored with even more images, since it’s book covers, and ordered them by color.\nTo have something more dynamic, I’m also testing a -12deg angle on the mosaics (why 12deg? Because I like it like that). It started with my conference transcripts where I use mosaics of the slides. But I’m also exploring this format for the weekly links now. I like it because it works with my design and breaks the straight horizontal lines a little bit.\nI’m not sure there’s generators or tools for collages. I do them in Sketch. But still, there’s a few tips and places you could use for inspiration:\nYou could explore with zero gutter collages (like mine). Or explore some styles with more spacing and gutter like Frontend Weekly does. If you go for gutters, which is, the most annoying thing to do, you need to make sure you have proper and consistent spacing everywhere. This is why I find this annoying to do. My trick here: cut the images if needed.\n\nAngle mosaics are trendy, also it works with gutters.\nYou could also use some grids of logos like here.\nAnd here are even more angled mosaics.\nLike images, you can bring consistency by applying a whole color overlay if you want. Or have them all black and white. Codrops is, again, an awesome example of this. Each of their roundups has a color filter which brings consistency to the whole mosaic.\n\nHave grid, then, break the grid and explore with diagonals and outside the box things. This is an old article from 2011 I still like on the topic of multiple image layout\n\n\nFind inspiration outside of the web: architecture and print design, magazine layouts are a good start here for that kind of ideas.\nAbstract art and backgrounds + some text.\nIt’s sometimes hard and long to find images, photos and illustrations. So, going abstract could also be an easy road to go. There’s a lot of generators in the next sections. Going abstract background + some simple text offers a LOT of possibilities while still keeping consistency around all your articles and posts and your brand. Just hit refresh on George’s generator here to know what I mean. Endless possibilities with little investment. Perfect if you don’t want to spend too much time but still want something nice.\nFor your inspiration, here’s a few examples of that abstract pattern trend.\n\nThis article on UX Planet uses some geometric background and just some text. Easy, effective.\n\nHere you have an example of just some background repeating pattern and some text as well.\nBig blue background, abstracted “f” geometric forms, here we go\n\n\nHere’s an example of a background and just a logo, that does the trick, simple, efficient.\n\nbugsnag.com uses those geometric shapes in their blog headers, it’s beautiful, abstract and it works nicely\nAbstract SVG and patterns generators\nThere’s plenty of places to find some nice abstract patterns. Most of them generate SVG, because it’s THE format that is perfect for that.\n\nHaikei.app is an webapp with 15 abstract SVG generators\n\nTabbied.com is a random geometric doodle shapes generator\nWhat about some springles or colored shapes? Check the rest out on bgjar.com\n\nI like glitchart.io, it can be used to create awesome things\nYou can find some awesome repeating patterns on heropatterns.com, pattern.monster\n\n\nMore polygon patterns in here. Yep, I love polygon patterns, sue me!\nIf you are looking for some cool polygon background and more: coolbackgrounds.io\n\nGenerate a pattern from a SVG you upload on this site and use it as background for text or other articles headings\nAnd another really cool pattern generator here \n\nGenerate patterns from different SVG icons with patternico.com\n\nIf you want a gif of “moving” backgrounds (I don’t think it’s a good idea since it might be annoying though) you could use Loading.io\n\nThis Sketch plugin generates confettis using patterns you created\nNo image, nice layout, beautiful typography, awesome colors\nLast but not least, you could also simply not have any header image. Or any decoration images except for when they help explain something. Those kinds of blogs usually rely on a nice layout, elegant typography, and a great use of colors, gradients, borders. Note that you still might need an image when sharing on social media though.\nHere are a few examples I like:\n\nTatiana Mac has a colorful blog, typography choices are awesome, no image needed.\n\nHugo Kitty Giraudel makes a nice use of gradient, again, no image needed\n\nSarah L. Fossheim has brings some awesome colors and borders\n\nGift Egwuenu has that awesome pink gradient border and the nicest title font face\n\nStephanie Stimac has those really nice purple links list\n\nEthan Marcotte’s blog is another beautiful of awesome typography, delicious subtle backgrounds, nothing more is needed here.\n\nJosh Comeau is also a nice example here if you are looking for simple effective typography\nAnother great one, but I’m biased because I love those Gs is Andy Bell’s Piccalil.li\n\nSo, that’s it. I hope I gave you nice ideas for different visual content and images for you blog posts, but also conference talks. Shoot me an email if you have more ideas or tools to share. Also big thanks to Myriam for helping me with that article 🙂"

a very long time –\nthough the domain and the underlying tech\n(and most of the content)\nhas shifted more than once.\nIs it still the same site,\nif I can just take out all the words,\nand put in new<span> </span>words?</p>\n<p>(<em>yes</em>)</p>\n<p>Over the last several years,\nI’ve leaned –\nor devolved? –\ninto an approach that is not quite\n<a href=\"https://maggieappleton.com/garden-history\">digital gardening</a>\nbut also not ‘posting’ in a blog format.\nIt’s become almost\na retroactive digital archive of shifting,\ncross-referenced,\nprojects and events.\nA digital timeline\nof what happened along the<span> </span>way.</p>\n<p>(<em>I have found\nthere are sometimes\ngood reasons to\n<a href=\"https://www.nngroup.com/articles/link-promise/\">break a promise</a></em>)</p>\n<p>Lately I’ve been\nfeeling the <em>evaporative</em>\nnature of so many art projects.\nI work hard,\nI’m proud of the work,\nbut once it’s done\nit becomes…\none more markdown entry to file away\nwith yaml metadata\nin this digital<span> </span>cabinet.</p>\n<p>A semi-sorted mound of detritus –\nthe results of living,\ntrying things,\nchanging my mind,\nand trying something else.\nA curriculum vitae,\nwith too much color and<span> </span>detail.</p>\n<p>(<em>let me show you the lovely flier\nfrom my

href=\"https://www.miriamsuzanne.com/theater/newworld/danny-deep/lights/\">my first one</a></em>)</p>\n<p>That feeling has bled into\nmy relationship with social media.\nI have a thought.\nI hit publish.\nThere is no middle step.\nI hit the nearest publish button I can find.\nIt’s on Twitter.\nA momentary live performance,\nand<span> </span>then…</p>\n<p>(<em>15 years on that site,\nand all I have to show for it\nare a load of lovely friends,\nsome acquaintances who seem swell,\na weirdly web-obsessed audience,\nand a few reply guys</em>)</p>\n<p>Somehow that all leads us here.\nAn attempt at reviving\nsomething more alive\n<em>inside the archive itself</em>.\n<a href=\"https://www.miriamsuzanne.com/2022/06/17/hit-publish/indiweb/\">Adding WebMentions</a>,\ncleaning up the <span>RSS</span> feed,\nand writing more…\nshort<span> </span>notes?</p>\n<p>(<em>have a thought,\nadd a commit message,\nwait for Netlify to publish</em>)</p>\n<p>I’ve also been\nreviving and curating my\nFeedly account,\nto get back in the habit\nof following other personal sites.\nMaybe even responding to them here?\nWho knows,\nmaybe there’s something to this\nidea of a\n<a href=\"https://chriscoyier.net/2022/04/29/rss-3/\">slow social</a><span> </span>back-and-forth.</p>\n<p>(<em>this is a reply to\n<a href=\"https://matthiasott.com/notes/just-put-stuff-out-there\" class=\"u-in-reply-to\">\nMatthias Ott</a>,\nbut you wouldn’t know it yet</em>)</p>\n<p>I’m attempting\nto develop a new habit,\nwith this site at the center.\nNot to post more or less,\nbut to think more carefully\nabout what I want from posting\nin the first place.\nThere’s no folder full of draft articles,\nor trello board of ideas,\nor resolution to post every day.\nOnly a mental reminder\nthat\n<em>I’m already posting\nall the time</em>.\nSharing,\nreplying,\ntesting ideas,\nhaving a<span> </span>laugh.</p>\n<p><em>Social posting.</em>\nIt’s a way of thinking out loud,\nand building relationships.\nI’m just not doing it here.\nPlatforms like Twitter\nmake the flow of conversation so easy.\nToo easy, sometimes.\nOther times, just<span> </span>right.</p>\n<p>I don’t want to lose that.\nBut what if some of those thoughts –\nsome parts of the conversation –\ncould also have a home\n(and a longer life) here?\nWhat if this site wasn’t only a log of past events,\nbut a place where <em>something can happen</em>?\nSomething social,<span> </span>even?</p>\n<p>(<em>syndication really is cool sometimes</em>)</p>\n<p>The latest post from Matthias\nis a lovely reminder\nurging us all to\n<a href=\"https://matthiasott.com/notes/just-put-stuff-out-there\">Just Put Stuff Out There</a> –\nwith a well-deserved shout-out\nto Chris Coyier’s\nregular short posts\nacross a wide range of topics.\nBoth Chris and Matthias\nhave been a big inspiration\nin pushing me to try<span> </span>this.</p>\n<p>(<em>it would be super embarrassing\nif this short note spirals into a long one</em>)</p>\n<p>I already put stuff out there.\nThe problem I have here is a little different.\nI tend towards the extremes.\nI will either write\nthe most in-depth\n<a href=\"https://css-tricks.com/css-cascade-layers/\">complete guide</a>\npossible –\nor I will condense the entire thought\n<a href=\"https://twitter.com/TerribleMia/status/1534946918509342726\">into 240 characters</a>\nand hit<span> </span>send.</p>\n<p>When I do start to get precious –\n<em>ahem</em> –\nit is absolutely helpful to remember\nI can ‘just hit publish’.\nBut right now\nit also feels helpful to take a second\nand ask:\n<em>What happens after I publish</em>?</p>\n<p>(<em>I spent hours writing this,\nand yes, I’m thoroughly embarrassed</em>)</p>\n<h2>(an after-thought, a chaser,

But, for the purposes of this article, I’m just going to list the ones that are most widely used as “second brains”/personal knowledge management systems:</p><ul><li><a href=\"https://www.notion.so/\">Notion</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://evernote.com/\">Evernote</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://roamresearch.com/\">Roam Research</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.microsoft.com/en-au/microsoft-365/onenote/digital-note-taking-app?ms.url=onenotecom&amp;rtc=1\">OneNote</a></li>\n<li><em><strong>Honourable mentions:</strong> <a href=\"https://workflowy.com/hi/\">Workflowy</a>, <a href=\"https://obsidian.md/\">Obsidian</a>, <a href=\"https://supernotes.app/\">Supernotes</a></em></li>\n</ul><p>All of the listed apps meet the requirements needed for a second brain/personal knowledge management system.

The challenge: it’s hard to decide which one’s the best for your use case and your note-taking style.\n\n<img src=\"https://nesslabs.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/cropped-favicon-ness-32x32.png\" alt=\"cropped-favicon-ness-32x32.png\" />\n<span>nesslabs.com</span>\n\n</a><p></p><h3>Step 2 – Create a general-purpose structure/wireframe</h3><p>Next, we need to structure our chosen application to allow us to capture, sort and retrieve relevant information efficiently. There’s two organisational systems that stand out here:</p><ul><li><a href=\"https://zettelkasten.de/introduction/\">Zettlekasten</a></li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"https://fortelabs.co/blog/para/\">The PARA Method</a> <em>(recommended)</em>\n</li>\n</ul><p>The <a href=\"https://zettelkasten.de/introduction/\">Zettlekasten</a> approach advocates for a disciplined approach to note-taking. Notes are captured “atomically” in the shortest and most modular manner possible. Once captured and split into components, you then search for other relevant notes you’ve taken in the past to link them to. Finally, you update your overall network of notes to make your recently captured note accessible. Having a network of notes is invaluable but it requires a lot of time and effort.</p><p><a href=\"https://fortelabs.co/blog/para/\">The PARA Method</a> reduces the fatigue of information capture. There’s no linking needed. It involves simply splitting all information into four categories based on purpose and timely relevance:</p><ul><li><em>(Tasks) – info stored in Projects or in memory</em></li>\n<li>\n<strong>Projects</strong> – goals to be achieved with deadlines – <em>info needed now</em>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Areas</strong> – standards/broad categories with no end date – <em>info needed a bit later</em>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Resources</strong> – topics/themes of ongoing interest – <em>info needed someday</em>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Archives</strong> – info that you won’t use for a while and doesn’t fit into the other three categories – <em>info not really needed/held just-in-case</em>\n</li>\n</ul><p>These categories are all nested. <strong>Tasks</strong> are nested under <strong>Projects</strong> which fall under <strong>Areas</strong> which fall under <strong>Resources</strong>, with <strong>Archives</strong> serving as the catch-all category.</p><p>Projects serve as your short-term memory and hold information you’ll likely need now/soon while the deeper you go (i.e. Areas → Resources → Archives), the later the information is needed.</p><p>It’s also a good idea to have an entrypoint (or Inbox) for all of your captured info before it’s sorted into one of the above categories.</p><h4><strong><em>Related reading</em></strong></h4><a href=\"https://www.zainrizvi.io/blog/remembering-what-you-read-zettelkasten-vs-para/\">\n<img src=\"https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1491309055486-24ae511c15c7?ixlib=rb-1.2.1&amp;q=80&amp;fm=jpg&amp;crop=entropy&amp;cs=tinysrgb&amp;w=2000&amp;fit=max&amp;ixid=eyJhcHBfaWQiOjExNzczfQ\" alt=\"photo-1491309055486-24ae511c15c7?ixlib=rb-1.2.1&amp;q=80&amp;fm=jpg&amp;crop=entropy&amp;cs=tinysrgb&amp;w=2000&amp;fit=max&amp;ixid=eyJhcHBfaWQiOjExNzczfQ\" />\n\n\nRemembering what you Read: Zettelkasten vs P.A.R.A.\nI spent over a year researching better ways to take notes and remember what I read. Here’s what I found.\n\n<img src=\"https://aseemthakar.com/favicon.png\" alt=\"favicon.png\" />\n<span>www.zainrizvi.io</span>\n\n</a><p></p><h3>Step 3 – Create data structures for captured information</h3><p>The above general-purpose wireframes describe <strong>where to position and sort information</strong>, but not <strong>how to describe information</strong> to meet our needs. We need to provide the right metadata in our captured information so that it can be easily organized and retrieved later.</p><p>This single article can never hope to encapsulate every single piece of information needed by every software developer. Still, here’s some examples of information most developers need and how they can effectively store it.</p><h4><strong>Q&amp;As – <em>building your own StackOverflow</em></strong></h4><p>Q&amp;As are the most raw and direct form of information. Our search for information starts based on a question we’re looking to have answered or a problem we want solved. Q&amp;As can typically be found on sites like StackOverflow or developer forums and online communities.</p><ul><li>\n<strong>Question</strong> – the question <em>you</em> had (not necessarily the question the source author had)</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Answer</strong> – the answer that helped <em>you</em> (if possible, rewrite the original answer to be more relevant to your original question)</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Tags</strong> – keywords to make this easily search-able in future</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Links/related reading</strong> – links to other useful information (keep your notes as lean as possible)</li>\n<li><em>(Date) – should be automatically captured by your note-taking app</em></li>\n</ul><h4><strong>Code snippets and boilerplates</strong></h4><p>Code snippets and boilerplates are extremely actionable and designed to be copy-pasted in specific contexts. When considering the data structure for these, note that code from one language and one context cannot necessarily be used in projects with a different language/context.</p><p>Also, unlike Q&amp;As, code snippets can’t be easily searched for based on their text contents. That’s why it’s important to put all snippets in a general structure (like a Notion database or a table with filters) that allows you to search based on language, type and context. For example, you should be able to search for all your <strong>front-end JavaScript</strong> snippets with a <strong>styling context</strong>.</p><ul><li>\n<strong>Language</strong> – <em>e.g. JavaScript, Python, Go</em>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Type</strong> – <em>e.g. front-end, back-end, deployment/DevOps</em>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Context</strong> – create your own multi-select categories to further describe the purpose of the snippet <em>e.g. is this to do with styling, making API calls, creating utility functions etc.</em>\n</li>\n<li><em>(<strong>Description</strong>) – a text-based description of the snippet</em></li>\n<li>\n<strong>Snippet</strong> – the actual snippet/boilerplate (wrapped in code tags)</li>\n<li><em>(<strong>Dependencies</strong>) – link to any other code or packages that are relevant or that you need to use this snippet</em></li>\n</ul><h4><strong>Documentation templates</strong></h4><p>These are basically text snippets. Templates for every bit of documentation your project needs like READMEs, CONTRIBUTING files, code review processes or test plans should be stored here.</p><p>While these are text-based, searching for a specific document (like a README) is still not easy as it sounds. That’s why, like code snippets, it’s important to keep documentation templates in a general structure that’s able to be filtered.</p><ul><li>\n<strong>Type</strong> – <em>e.g. front-end, back-end, deployment/DevOps</em>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Location</strong> – where does this template go? <em>e.g. repository, project management, client</em>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Title</strong> – <em>e.g. README, CONTRIBUTING, QA plan</em>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Template</strong> – the actual template</li>\n<li><em>(<strong>Description</strong>) – a text-based description of the snippet</em></li>\n</ul><h4><strong>Resources</strong></h4><p>Resources are the least actionable, but most educative forms of information. They are the videos, courses, tutorials (and more) that you look for when you want to learn more about a broad area rather than fix a specific issue.</p><p>For instance, if you wanted to learn about Python, you’d save the best Python learning resources (i.e. tutorials, videos, articles and courses) you’ve come across in your second brain. This way, if you ever want to learn about Python in the future, you don’t have to repeat your search.</p><p>Since resources are your version of longer-term memory, you have to put some effort into making them easily retrievable in future.</p><ul><li>\n<strong>Name</strong> – a search-optimized name of the resource</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Author</strong> – the original author of the resource</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Category</strong> – <em>e.g. video, article, book, tweet, course, website</em>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong>URL</strong> – where can you access this resource <em>(note – you don’t want the entire resource in your database, you just want a link to minimise bloat)</em>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Status</strong> – have you completed reviewing this resource?</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Tags</strong> – keywords not in the name to make this easily search-able in future</li>\n<li><em><strong>(Rating)</strong> – how effective this resource is at solving your problem or teaching you something</em></li>\n</ul><h3>Step 4 – Determine your information workflows</h3><p>The priority now is figuring out:</p><ul><li>How you’ll approach <strong>finding</strong> the information you need to solve problems</li>\n<li>How information will be <strong>sorted</strong> once it arrives into your second brain</li>\n</ul><h4><strong>Finding info</strong></h4><p>This is the part where you add your second brain to your information supply chain. Instead of going directly to Google when you have a particular issue, you now go to your second brain first.</p><p>Since we’ve neatly organised our content based on its purpose, relevance and timeliness, here’s our workflow for finding the information we need to solve problems we come across:</p><img src=\"https://aseemthakar.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Untitled3-1024x454.webp\" alt=\"\" width=\"604\" height=\"267\" /><h4><strong>Sorting info</strong></h4><p>Ideally, you’ll have an inbox section where all incoming captured info is preliminarily stored. From here, it needs to be sorted into the appropriate category (based on the PARA method).</p><p>Depending on how relevant and timely it is, it needs to go into the appropriate project, area or resource umbrella.</p><img src=\"https://aseemthakar.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Untitled4-1024x128.webp\" alt=\"\" width=\"786\" height=\"98\" /><p>For instance, if you’re currently working on a MERN stack project, then a code snippet on <em>“How to set up MongoDB with Express”</em> is very relevant and should go in the appropriate Project section. On the other hand, a tutorial on <em>“How to create a REST API with Django”</em> is less relevant and might go in the Resources section for future use.</p><p>You’ll ideally want to sort daily to review your incoming information and prevent <a href=\"https://www.interaction-design.org/literature/article/information-overload-why-it-matters-and-how-to-combat-it\">information overload</a>.</p><h4><strong><em>Related reading</em></strong></h4><a href=\"https://tressel.xyz\">\nTressel | Save tweets &amp; threads to Notion, Obsidian &amp; Evernote\nA web app to save tweets &amp; threads from Twitter to Notion, Evernote &amp; Obsidian for free (with premium features available)\n<span>tressel.xyz</span>\n</a><p></p><h2><strong>Summary – flowchart</strong></h2><img width=\"1000\" height=\"706\" src=\"https://aseemthakar.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Untitled5.webp\" alt=\"\" /><p>This is by no means a comprehensive guide.

Quick capture and editing\n2. Scales to thousands of notes without performance lag\n3. Basic formatting options\n4. Strong search feature\n5. Ability to handle images and attachments\n6. Private space, with public sharing\n\nMust-haves\n7. At least 3 levels of hierarchy\n8. Many ways to capture information\n9. Native and web versions\n10. Capturing and syncing across multiple devices\n11. Exportable as plain text\n\nNice-to-haves\n12. Side-by-side viewing\n13. Bullets or lists\n14. Automatic date stamps\n15. Tags\nWhile it’s possible to use manual methods like a notebook or sticky notes, it’s difficult to scale these to thousands of notes, handle images and code snippets, allow portability for quick capture/editing and most importantly allow for searchability.Hence why a digital system is essential (especially in the context of software development).At time of writing, there are heaps of digital note-taking apps in the market. But, for the purposes of this article, I’m just going to list the ones that are most widely used as “second brains”/personal knowledge management systems:Notion\nEvernote\nRoam Research\nOneNote\nHonourable mentions: Workflowy, Obsidian, Supernotes\nAll of the listed apps meet the requirements needed for a second brain/personal knowledge management system. Each app works in different ways and has its benefits and drawbacks so pick the one that works best for you. Your second brain is for your eyes and use, not someone else’s.If you use Notion, Obsidian or Evernote, you might be interested in Tressel – an app that seamlessly syncs your info from around the web (from places like Twitter and Reddit) to your note-taking appsRelated reading\n\n\n\nThe Essential Requirements for Choosing a Notes App as Your Second Brain – Forte Labs\nI’ve argued strongly for the category of notes apps as the ideal home of your personal knowledge library, which I call a “second brain.” I believe there are ten core capabilities that digital apps uniquely provide to the note-taking process: Searchability: type in a few characters and see everything that matches, regardless of where it’s … Read more\n\nfortelabs.co\n\n\n\n\n\nHow to choose the right note-taking app\nThere’s a note-taking app for everyone. The challenge: it’s hard to decide which one’s the best for your use case and your note-taking style.\n\nnesslabs.com\n\nStep 2 – Create a general-purpose structure/wireframeNext, we need to structure our chosen application to allow us to capture, sort and retrieve relevant information efficiently. There’s two organisational systems that stand out here:Zettlekasten\n\nThe PARA Method (recommended)\n\nThe Zettlekasten approach advocates for a disciplined approach to note-taking. Notes are captured “atomically” in the shortest and most modular manner possible. Once captured and split into components, you then search for other relevant notes you’ve taken in the past to link them to. Finally, you update your overall network of notes to make your recently captured note accessible. Having a network of notes is invaluable but it requires a lot of time and effort.The PARA Method reduces the fatigue of information capture. There’s no linking needed. It involves simply splitting all information into four categories based on purpose and timely relevance:(Tasks) – info stored in Projects or in memory\n\nProjects – goals to be achieved with deadlines – info needed now\n\n\nAreas – standards/broad categories with no end date – info needed a bit later\n\n\nResources – topics/themes of ongoing interest – info needed someday\n\n\nArchives – info that you won’t use for a while and doesn’t fit into the other three categories – info not really needed/held just-in-case\n\nThese categories are all nested. Tasks are nested under Projects which fall under Areas which fall under Resources, with Archives serving as the catch-all category.Projects serve as your short-term memory and hold information you’ll likely need now/soon while the deeper you go (i.e. Areas → Resources → Archives), the later the information is needed.It’s also a good idea to have an entrypoint (or Inbox) for all of your captured info before it’s sorted into one of the above categories.Related reading\n\n\n\nRemembering what you Read: Zettelkasten vs P.A.R.A.\nI spent over a year researching better ways to take notes and remember what I read. Here’s what I found.\n\nwww.zainrizvi.io\n\nStep 3 – Create data structures for captured informationThe above general-purpose wireframes describe where to position and sort information, but not how to describe information to meet our needs. We need to provide the right metadata in our captured information so that it can be easily organized and retrieved later.This single article can never hope to encapsulate every single piece of information needed by every software developer. Still, here’s some examples of information most developers need and how they can effectively store it.Q&As – building your own StackOverflowQ&As are the most raw and direct form of information. Our search for information starts based on a question we’re looking to have answered or a problem we want solved. Q&As can typically be found on sites like StackOverflow or developer forums and online communities.\nQuestion – the question you had (not necessarily the question the source author had)\n\nAnswer – the answer that helped you (if possible, rewrite the original answer to be more relevant to your original question)\n\nTags – keywords to make this easily search-able in future\n\nLinks/related reading – links to other useful information (keep your notes as lean as possible)\n(Date) – should be automatically captured by your note-taking app\nCode snippets and boilerplatesCode snippets and boilerplates are extremely actionable and designed to be copy-pasted in specific contexts. When considering the data structure for these, note that code from one language and one context cannot necessarily be used in projects with a different language/context.Also, unlike Q&As, code snippets can’t be easily searched for based on their text contents. That’s why it’s important to put all snippets in a general structure (like a Notion database or a table with filters) that allows you to search based on language, type and context. For example, you should be able to search for all your front-end JavaScript snippets with a styling context.\nLanguage – e.g. JavaScript, Python, Go\n\n\nType – e.g. front-end, back-end, deployment/DevOps\n\n\nContext – create your own multi-select categories to further describe the purpose of the snippet e.g. is this to do with styling, making API calls, creating utility functions etc.\n\n(Description) – a text-based description of the snippet\n\nSnippet – the actual snippet/boilerplate (wrapped in code tags)\n(Dependencies) – link to any other code or packages that are relevant or that you need to use this snippet\nDocumentation templatesThese are basically text snippets. Templates for every bit of documentation your project needs like READMEs, CONTRIBUTING files, code review processes or test plans should be stored here.While these are text-based, searching for a specific document (like a README) is still not easy as it sounds. That’s why, like code snippets, it’s important to keep documentation templates in a general structure that’s able to be filtered.\nType – e.g. front-end, back-end, deployment/DevOps\n\n\nLocation – where does this template go? e.g. repository, project management, client\n\n\nTitle – e.g. README, CONTRIBUTING, QA plan\n\n\nTemplate – the actual template\n(Description) – a text-based description of the snippet\nResourcesResources are the least actionable, but most educative forms of information. They are the videos, courses, tutorials (and more) that you look for when you want to learn more about a broad area rather than fix a specific issue.For instance, if you wanted to learn about Python, you’d save the best Python learning resources (i.e. tutorials, videos, articles and courses) you’ve come across in your second brain. This way, if you ever want to learn about Python in the future, you don’t have to repeat your search.Since resources are your version of longer-term memory, you have to put some effort into making them easily retrievable in future.\nName – a search-optimized name of the resource\n\nAuthor – the original author of the resource\n\nCategory – e.g. video, article, book, tweet, course, website\n\n\nURL – where can you access this resource (note – you don’t want the entire resource in your database, you just want a link to minimise bloat)\n\n\nStatus – have you completed reviewing this resource?\n\nTags – keywords not in the name to make this easily search-able in future\n(Rating) – how effective this resource is at solving your problem or teaching you something\nStep 4 – Determine your information workflowsThe priority now is figuring out:How you’ll approach finding the information you need to solve problems\nHow information will be sorted once it arrives into your second brain\nFinding infoThis is the part where you add your second brain to your information supply chain. Instead of going directly to Google when you have a particular issue, you now go to your second brain first.Since we’ve neatly organised our content based on its purpose, relevance and timeliness, here’s our workflow for finding the information we need to solve problems we come across:Sorting infoIdeally, you’ll have an inbox section where all incoming captured info is preliminarily stored. From here, it needs to be sorted into the appropriate category (based on the PARA method).Depending on how relevant and timely it is, it needs to go into the appropriate project, area or resource umbrella.For instance, if you’re currently working on a MERN stack project, then a code snippet on “How to set up MongoDB with Express” is very relevant and should go in the appropriate Project section. On the other hand, a tutorial on “How to create a REST API with Django” is less relevant and might go in the Resources section for future use.You’ll ideally want to sort daily to review your incoming information and prevent information overload.Related reading\nTressel | Save tweets & threads to Notion, Obsidian & Evernote\nA web app to save tweets & threads from Twitter to Notion, Evernote & Obsidian for free (with premium features available)\ntressel.xyz\nSummary – flowchartThis is by no means a comprehensive guide. I fully acknowledge that I may have missed out on a lot of information you need to get a well-oiled second brain system working. For a more complete, general-purpose guide on how to build a second brain, check out Tiago Forte’s course. He’s far more of an authority on personal knowledge management/second brain systems than I am.My main goal with this article was to show all developers that the shot-gun approach of Googling every single problem they come across is inefficient and unproductive. I hope I accomplished that and showed you a better way of doing things.Further reading\n\n\n\nBuilding a Second Brain: An Overview – Forte Labs\nThis is a summary of Building a Second Brain, my online course on capturing, organizing, and sharing your knowledge using digital notes.

You can use something completely different and follow all the other steps in this post if you’d prefer. The steps further down assume:</p>\n<ol><li>that your blog posts exist in markdown in a folder on your computer, and</li>\n  <li>that you use jekyll or hugo to generate your site. \nIf you’re not using jekyll or hugo, all of these steps except obyde will work without modification. With minor modifications, obyde should work as well.</li>\n</ol><p>I won’t go into details on how I set up my Github Page, the most up-to-date instructions will be <a href=\"https://pages.github.com/\">here</a>. For my blog, I went with the <a href=\"https://github.com/riggraz/no-style-please\">no-style-please theme</a>, as I wanted a theme as simple and Craigslist-like as possible. You’ll notice that I <a href=\"https://github.com/person-al/person-al.github.io/tree/main/_sass\">copied the style’s css into the project</a> so I could customize it. The biggest modification I made was to remove their dark-mode support from the css file and import <a href=\"https://watercss.kognise.dev/\">water.css</a> for dark-mode instead. No-style-please implements dark-mode itself by inverting all the colors except image colors. This worked well 99% of the time, except…emoji colors would get inverted. While I could have tried to fix it, it didn’t feel worth it. My goal was simplicity, not dependency elimination. Water provides a more aesthetically pleasing dark-mode as it is, which felt worthwhile.</p>\n\n<h3>2. set up your folder</h3>\n<p>Unless you want 100% of your vault published at all times, you’ll want to set up a specific folder in your vault that contains blog posts. Name the folder however you’d like and I recommend adding two subfolders: one for drafts and one for assets. This is optional, but I’ve found it useful to have everything meant for publishing in one place.</p>\n\n<h3>3. set up obyde</h3>\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/khalednassar/obyde\">Obyde</a> is the secret sauce holding my blog together and I highly recommend it if you’re using markdown and jekyll/hugo. <a href=\"https://github.com/khalednassar\">khalednassar</a>, the developer, responds quickly and amenably to questions, pull requests, and bug reports. They deserve major kudos for this tool.</p>\n\n<p>Obyde takes a markdown file with frontmatter in one folder and converts it to a jekyll blog post file in another folder. The instructions for setup are <a href=\"https://github.com/khalednassar/obyde#obyde\">here</a>. Note that under the <a href=\"https://github.com/khalednassar/obyde#usage\">usage</a> section where it describes the config file, you’ll want to list the assets sub-folder in your vault and list your drafts folder under <code>excluded_subdirectories</code>.</p>\n\n<p>What I’ve done is keep the obyde config file in my GithubPages repo, but add it to my <code>.gitignore</code>. The benefit is that all of the code related to my blog is in one place (the GithubPages repo), but the relative path to my vault and specific folder names in my vault are not published on the internet.</p>\n\n<p>Now you’re ready to publish!</p>\n\n<h2>publishing steps</h2>\n<ol><li>Create a note with all the metadata needed for Jekyll and store in my blog folder</li>\n  <li>Run obyde script to convert vault files into blog posts</li>\n  <li>Push changes to blog to GitHub</li>\n</ol><h3>1. create your note</h3>\n<p>Create a note in the blog subfolder of your vault. It can really look like anything at all, the only requirement is that it have the <a href=\"https://github.com/khalednassar/obyde#caveat\">date frontmatter</a> so that obyde can convert it to a jekyll-style post file. This is the only change you’d need to make in order to use obyde without using jekyll or hugo. You’d either need to modify how obyde sets the post title to avoid needing the date frontmatter or, more reasonably, just add the date frontmatter regardless of whether your blog system needs it or not. Once you’ve made a few blog posts this way and have a better sense of what matters to you, consider <a href=\"https://person-al.github.io/%F0%9F%8C%B3/2022/05/08/how-i-publish-my-zettelkasten.html#templates-are-your-friend\">using templates</a>.</p>\n\n<h3>2. run obyde</h3>\n<p>Running obyde the standard way is a one-line command. However, I’ve created <a href=\"https://github.com/person-al/person-al.github.io/blob/main/obsidian_to_jekyll.sh\">a script to run obyde against my vault</a>. So once I’ve finished making my note and putting it in my blog older, I just need to run the script. Part of the Zettelkasten approach means that my posts get updated and modified <em>constantly</em>, so just running obyde’s default script isn’t enough. You’ll notice in the script that I delete all my posts and <em>then</em> run obyde so that it catches all the changes in my vault. Because my blog is also a github repo, I can use regular git tools like <code>git status</code> or <code>git add -p</code> to see what’s changed in already-published posts and make sure those changes are what I expected.</p>\n\n<p>Once you’ve run the obyde script, you should see a bunch of posts in your blog’s posts folder. Take a look and make sure everything is as you expect it to be.</p>\n\n<h3>3. push to Github</h3>\n<p>The beauty of Github Page is that updating anything about your blog is a push away. Commit and push your changes and your blog will rebuild within minutes.</p>\n\n<p>Congrats! You’ve just published your Obsidian vault. Now go forth and create away! After you’ve made a few posts, feel free to come back and check out the “extra goodies” below where I discuss how handle intermediate use-cases like templates, hiding private notes, and connecting with the decentralized web.</p>\n\n<p>Have fun posting!</p>\n\n<h2>extra goodies</h2>\n<p>Once you’ve made a few posts, you’ll probably need one or more of the following goodies:</p>\n<ul><li><a href=\"https://person-al.github.io/%F0%9F%8C%B3/2022/05/08/how-i-publish-my-zettelkasten.html#templates-are-your-friend\">templates</a></li>\n  <li><a href=\"https://person-al.github.io/%F0%9F%8C%B3/2022/05/08/how-i-publish-my-zettelkasten.html#hiding-parts-of-notes\">hiding parts of notes</a></li>\n  <li><a href=\"https://person-al.github.io/%F0%9F%8C%B3/2022/05/08/how-i-publish-my-zettelkasten.html#joining-the-indieweb\">joining the IndieWeb</a></li>\n</ul><h3>templates are your friend</h3>\n<p>While the date is the only required field in your post’s frontmatter, you likely have others that matter to you. The layout, the category, tags, etc. From that perspective, templates are your friend. Whether it’s Obsidian’s built-in template tool or the Templater plugin or your own third-party template system, I recommend setting up a template so consistent blog post formatting is only a hot-key away. My template looks something like this:</p>\n<pre><code>---\nlayout: post\ncategory: 🗨️|❔|🌰|🌱|🌳|🌲\ntitle: \"&lt;% tp.file.title %&gt;\"\ndate: &lt;% tp.file.creation_date(\"YYYY-MM-DD\") %&gt;\n---\n</code></pre>\n<p>You’ll notice that it sets required jekyll metadata like the layout and the date, as well as optional metadata that matters to me, like a list of categories for me to choose from.</p>\n\n<p>The reason I add the title to the metadata is because of a difference in how jekyll titles notes vs. your computer. In Zettelkasten, your note title is often the thesis of the note. You’ll see this in my blog with lengthy post titles like <a href=\"https://person-al.github.io/%F0%9F%8C%B0/2021/06/19/recognition-matters-human-beings-need-to-feel-understood.html\">🌰 recognition matters - human beings need to feel understood</a>. It’s almost what you’d expect from a blog title but significantly more specific and more likely to use punctuation. Jekyll, however, doesn’t support punctuation in file titles. Which means if my file name is <a href=\"https://person-al.github.io/%F0%9F%8C%B0/2021/08/02/i-m-struggling-with-a-piece-about-business-writers.html\">🌰 I’m struggling with a piece about business writers</a>.md, jekyll will rename that to <code>i-m-struggling-with...</code>, which will then get converted to the title “I m struggling with…”, with a weird space where the apostrophe should be. I get around this by adding the <code>title</code> metadata to the frontmatter automatically. That way jekyll never accidentally skips punctuation. The downside is that every time I change the title of a published blog post, I have to update the <code>title</code> frontmatter as well. But it’s worth it for me.</p>\n\n<p>Template or no, just make sure you have the <code>date</code> frontmatter as obyde needs it to convert your file to a jekyll-compatible blog post.</p>\n\n<h3>hiding parts of notes</h3>\n<p>Sometimes, you want to publish a note without publishing <em>all</em> of a note. Maybe you reference a person or a place that you’d prefer not to publicize, or maybe you just have a way of formatting things in your vault that will confuse public readers. Take, for example, a post like <a href=\"https://person-al.github.io/%F0%9F%97%A8%EF%B8%8F/2021/06/27/a-dog-always-bit-deepest-on-the-veterinary-hand.html\">🗨️ A dog always bit deepest on the veterinary hand.</a> In my case, it’s just a simple quote, but in someone else’s vault it might be accompanied by an MLA citation or a longer journal entry. This is where obyde’s <a href=\"https://github.com/khalednassar/obyde#options\">find-and-replace feature</a> shines.<a href=\"https://person-al.github.io/%F0%9F%8C%B3/2022/05/08/how-i-publish-my-zettelkasten.html#fn:1\">1</a></p>\n\n<p>Find-and-replace works exactly how it says on the tin. I use it liberally. My actual post template looks something like this:</p>\n<pre><code>---\nlayout: post\ncategory: 🗨️|❔|🌰|🌱|🌳|🌲\ntitle: \"&lt;% tp.file.title %&gt;\"\ndate: &lt;% tp.file.creation_date(\"YYYY-MM-DD\") %&gt;\nfind: [\"find\\\\:\\\\n(- .*\\\\n)+\",\"replace\\\\:\\\\n(- .*\\\\n)+\",\"LEAVE_OUT\\\\:.*($|\\\\n)\",\"tags-for-github\"]\nreplace: [\"\",\"\",\"\",\"tags\"]\ntags-for-github:\n---\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>A few things to notice:</p>\n<ul><li>I use the list format instead of the “every line” format. This is marginally worse than the every line format in that it’s much harder to count and match the <code>find</code> line elements with the <code>replace</code> line elements. But it’s marginally better in that it compresses that long list above to 4 lines instead of 10 lines.</li>\n  <li>I remove the find and replace lines themselves from the published piece. Because what’s the point in changing things if I’m going to publish exactly what changed lol. You’ll also notice here how <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regular_expression\">regexes</a> can be used. If you don’t know what regexes are, suffice it to say that <code>find\\\\:\\\\n(- .*\\\\n)+</code> is telling obyde “I want you to find a line that starts with <code>find:</code> and is followed by a series of bullet points after it. And then remove all of that.”<a href=\"https://person-al.github.io/%F0%9F%8C%B3/2022/05/08/how-i-publish-my-zettelkasten.html#fn:2\">2</a></li>\n  <li>An example of removing things: any line that begins with <code>LEAVE_OUT:</code> will not be put in the final blog post by obyde. That allows me to say, mention my mother in a relevant note while preventing such a mention from making it to the world wide web.</li>\n  <li>An example of reformatting: I don’t use Obsidian’s tags for categorizing. But I do want to use tags in jekyll. So instead of putting <code>tags</code> in my frontmatter, which Obsidian would pick up on and use, I instead have <code>tags-for-github</code>, which obyde smart-converts to <code>tags</code> when making the final blog post.</li>\n</ul><p>It takes some understanding of regexes to properly use the find-replace feature, but I highly recommend using it if you want to keep one vault and publish only a segment of it. The alternative, of course, is to have a separate vault that gets published. In that case, find-replace is unnecessary.</p>\n\n<h3>joining the IndieWeb</h3>\n<p>By posting a blog, you’re already part of <a href=\"https://indieweb.org/\">IndieWeb</a>! IndieWeb is a decentralized consortium of personally-owned blogs. It’s a community dedicated to helping you own and manage your content.</p>\n\n<p>Corporate silos like Facebook and Twitter benefit from their proprietary formatting and following systems. Facebook knows exactly how to notify you when someone likes a post you follow, etc. With the independent web, there are some standards folks use to bring some of those benefits to a decentralized publishing ecosystem. That’s where the <a href=\"https://indieweb.org/\">IndieWeb</a> shines. I recommend going through the <a href=\"https://indiewebify.me/\">list of tools</a> to see which make sense for you. I’ve made it through Level 2, which means I finished getting webmention reception support working!  I don’t yet display webmentions on the site, but perhaps that’s something I can work on soon.</p>\n\n  <ol><li>\n      <p>Find-and-replace came about from me needing to optionally hide or reformat parts of my notes as described above. I made it work, put it in a pull request, and khalednassar kindly reviewed it and merged it in. If you’re not a developer, this is kind of like if khalednassar had written a 10-chapter novel in a public place with a note that said “please add to this”. And then I came along with a new chapter and said “Yo, check this out, it fits right between chapters 4 and 5.” And then khalednassar had to proof-read my addition <em>and</em> make sure the new version of the novel was still cohesive and worth reading. On the one hand, the whole beauty of public Github repos is that someone <em>can</em> come add new functionality to your work. But on the other hand, managing code suggestions from other people is hard and much kudos to khalednassar for being open to it. <a href=\"https://person-al.github.io/%F0%9F%8C%B3/2022/05/08/how-i-publish-my-zettelkasten.html#fnref:1\">↩</a></p>\n    </li>\n    <li>\n      <p>This regex isn’t perfect. If one of the items in the find-replace list spans more than one line, this regex can’t catch that. I haven’t figured out what to do about that yet… <a href=\"https://person-al.github.io/%F0%9F%8C%B3/2022/05/08/how-i-publish-my-zettelkasten.html#fnref:2\">↩</a></p>\n    </li>\n  </ol>\n\n    \n    <b>Did you comment on this?

It can really look like anything at all, the only requirement is that it have the date frontmatter so that obyde can convert it to a jekyll-style post file. This is the only change you’d need to make in order to use obyde without using jekyll or hugo. You’d either need to modify how obyde sets the post title to avoid needing the date frontmatter or, more reasonably, just add the date frontmatter regardless of whether your blog system needs it or not. Once you’ve made a few blog posts this way and have a better sense of what matters to you, consider using templates.\n\n2. run obyde\nRunning obyde the standard way is a one-line command. However, I’ve created a script to run obyde against my vault. So once I’ve finished making my note and putting it in my blog older, I just need to run the script. Part of the Zettelkasten approach means that my posts get updated and modified constantly, so just running obyde’s default script isn’t enough. You’ll notice in the script that I delete all my posts and then run obyde so that it catches all the changes in my vault. Because my blog is also a github repo, I can use regular git tools like git status or git add -p to see what’s changed in already-published posts and make sure those changes are what I expected.\n\nOnce you’ve run the obyde script, you should see a bunch of posts in your blog’s posts folder. Take a look and make sure everything is as you expect it to be.\n\n3. push to Github\nThe beauty of Github Page is that updating anything about your blog is a push away. Commit and push your changes and your blog will rebuild within minutes.\n\nCongrats! You’ve just published your Obsidian vault. Now go forth and create away! After you’ve made a few posts, feel free to come back and check out the “extra goodies” below where I discuss how handle intermediate use-cases like templates, hiding private notes, and connecting with the decentralized web.\n\nHave fun posting!\n\nextra goodies\nOnce you’ve made a few posts, you’ll probably need one or more of the following goodies:\ntemplates\n  hiding parts of notes\n  joining the IndieWeb\ntemplates are your friend\nWhile the date is the only required field in your post’s frontmatter, you likely have others that matter to you. The layout, the category, tags, etc. From that perspective, templates are your friend. Whether it’s Obsidian’s built-in template tool or the Templater plugin or your own third-party template system, I recommend setting up a template so consistent blog post formatting is only a hot-key away. My template looks something like this:\n---\nlayout: post\ncategory: 🗨️|❔|🌰|🌱|🌳|🌲\ntitle: \"<% tp.file.title %>\"\ndate: <% tp.file.creation_date(\"YYYY-MM-DD\") %>\n---\n\nYou’ll notice that it sets required jekyll metadata like the layout and the date, as well as optional metadata that matters to me, like a list of categories for me to choose from.\n\nThe reason I add the title to the metadata is because of a difference in how jekyll titles notes vs. your computer. In Zettelkasten, your note title is often the thesis of the note. You’ll see this in my blog with lengthy post titles like 🌰 recognition matters - human beings need to feel understood. It’s almost what you’d expect from a blog title but significantly more specific and more likely to use punctuation. Jekyll, however, doesn’t support punctuation in file titles. Which means if my file name is 🌰 I’m struggling with a piece about business writers.md, jekyll will rename that to i-m-struggling-with..., which will then get converted to the title “I m struggling with…”, with a weird space where the apostrophe should be. I get around this by adding the title metadata to the frontmatter automatically. That way jekyll never accidentally skips punctuation. The downside is that every time I change the title of a published blog post, I have to update the title frontmatter as well. But it’s worth it for me.\n\nTemplate or no, just make sure you have the date frontmatter as obyde needs it to convert your file to a jekyll-compatible blog post.\n\nhiding parts of notes\nSometimes, you want to publish a note without publishing all of a note. Maybe you reference a person or a place that you’d prefer not to publicize, or maybe you just have a way of formatting things in your vault that will confuse public readers. Take, for example, a post like 🗨️ A dog always bit deepest on the veterinary hand. In my case, it’s just a simple quote, but in someone else’s vault it might be accompanied by an MLA citation or a longer journal entry. This is where obyde’s find-and-replace feature shines.1\n\nFind-and-replace works exactly how it says on the tin. I use it liberally. My actual post template looks something like this:\n---\nlayout: post\ncategory: 🗨️|❔|🌰|🌱|🌳|🌲\ntitle: \"<% tp.file.title %>\"\ndate: <% tp.file.creation_date(\"YYYY-MM-DD\") %>\nfind: [\"find\\\\:\\\\n(- .*\\\\n)+\",\"replace\\\\:\\\\n(- .*\\\\n)+\",\"LEAVE_OUT\\\\:.*($|\\\\n)\",\"tags-for-github\"]\nreplace: [\"\",\"\",\"\",\"tags\"]\ntags-for-github:\n---\n\n\nA few things to notice:\nI use the list format instead of the “every line” format. This is marginally worse than the every line format in that it’s much harder to count and match the find line elements with the replace line elements. But it’s marginally better in that it compresses that long list above to 4 lines instead of 10 lines.\n  I remove the find and replace lines themselves from the published piece. Because what’s the point in changing things if I’m going to publish exactly what changed lol. You’ll also notice here how regexes can be used. If you don’t know what regexes are, suffice it to say that find\\\\:\\\\n(- .*\\\\n)+ is telling obyde “I want you to find a line that starts with find: and is followed by a series of bullet points after it. And then remove all of that.”2\n  An example of removing things: any line that begins with LEAVE_OUT: will not be put in the final blog post by obyde. That allows me to say, mention my mother in a relevant note while preventing such a mention from making it to the world wide web.\n  An example of reformatting: I don’t use Obsidian’s tags for categorizing. But I do want to use tags in jekyll. So instead of putting tags in my frontmatter, which Obsidian would pick up on and use, I instead have tags-for-github, which obyde smart-converts to tags when making the final blog post.\nIt takes some understanding of regexes to properly use the find-replace feature, but I highly recommend using it if you want to keep one vault and publish only a segment of it. The alternative, of course, is to have a separate vault that gets published. In that case, find-replace is unnecessary.\n\njoining the IndieWeb\nBy posting a blog, you’re already part of IndieWeb! IndieWeb is a decentralized consortium of personally-owned blogs. It’s a community dedicated to helping you own and manage your content.\n\nCorporate silos like Facebook and Twitter benefit from their proprietary formatting and following systems. Facebook knows exactly how to notify you when someone likes a post you follow, etc. With the independent web, there are some standards folks use to bring some of those benefits to a decentralized publishing ecosystem. That’s where the IndieWeb shines. I recommend going through the list of tools to see which make sense for you. I’ve made it through Level 2, which means I finished getting webmention reception support working!  I don’t yet display webmentions on the site, but perhaps that’s something I can work on soon.\n\n  \n      Find-and-replace came about from me needing to optionally hide or reformat parts of my notes as described above. I made it work, put it in a pull request, and khalednassar kindly reviewed it and merged it in. If you’re not a developer, this is kind of like if khalednassar had written a 10-chapter novel in a public place with a note that said “please add to this”. And then I came along with a new chapter and said “Yo, check this out, it fits right between chapters 4 and 5.” And then khalednassar had to proof-read my addition and make sure the new version of the novel was still cohesive and worth reading. On the one hand, the whole beauty of public Github repos is that someone can come add new functionality to your work. But on the other hand, managing code suggestions from other people is hard and much kudos to khalednassar for being open to it. ↩\n    \n    \n      This regex isn’t perfect. If one of the items in the find-replace list spans more than one line, this regex can’t catch that. I haven’t figured out what to do about that yet… ↩\n    \n  Did you comment on this? Send me the URL:\n    \n        Link to the page you're commenting on:\n        \n    \n        \n    Don't want to do that? @ me on twitter or mastodon\n\nEvery post on this blog is a work in progress. Phrasing may be less than ideal, ideas may not yet be fully thought through. Thank you for watching me grow."

Of course, I don’t use the backend James uses, so that’s what I needed to sort out on my own.</p>\n<p>Where should the information for a hovercard come from? The most straightforward approach is to use the information that the linked page provides about itself. For the reasons I laid out <a href=\"https://evgenykuznetsov.org/en/posts/2020/indieweb-glue/\">earlier</a>, I didn’t want to pre-fetch and store that information the way James does, so the obvious solution was to leverage <a href=\"https://indieweb-glue.evgenykuznetsov.org\">indieweb-glue</a>. Of course, it had to be taught to return the information about pages in addition to people. One form for a page to provide such information about itself is the <a href=\"https://ogp.me/\">Open Graph protocol</a>, it is rather widely used, so that’s what I decided to start with.</p>\n<p>After some mild code refactoring, I added Open Graph meta tags processing to <code>indieweb-glue</code> and <a href=\"https://evgenykuznetsov.org/git/?p=hovercard.js.git\">modified</a> James’s script to fetch the information from there. I also made it look for a specified class instead of an <code>&lt;article&gt;</code> tag since it gives me more control over which pages and parts of the pages hovercards appear on. With some CSS thrown into the mix, it’s all working quite to my satisfaction now. Surprisingly so, I must say.</p>\n<p>As an added benefit, the same script can be used to produce hovercards for footnotes<a href=\"https://evgenykuznetsov.org/en/posts/2022/hovercards/#fn:1\">1</a> on the fly, and that’s something I’m even more fond of. Footnotes have been my pet peeve for a long time. They are a really nice instrument to have when writing a text, allowing one to avoid interrupting the flow of thought with distractions and digressions. However, in digital media, footnotes are often hidden beyond the screen edge, and scrolling or following a link to look at them is usually too much distraction. On paper, all you need to do is look down, and we are good enough at returning our sight focus back to where it was on the page so that taking a look at a footnote doesn’t interrupt our reading process too much. Having footnotes in hovercards feels like a reasonable compromise.</p>\n<p>The result is not yet perfect, and all this is still a work in progress. CSS needs more figuring out: my hovercards don’t always look good, especially when the image is in portrait orientation. Also, <code>indieweb-glue</code> could (and should) use things beyond the Open Graph protocol to extract useful info from web pages. A good example is Wikipedia: its pages lack <code>og:description</code>, but the first paragraph of the text itself looks like a perfect thing to have in a hovercard linking to a Wikipedia page<a href=\"https://evgenykuznetsov.org/en/posts/2022/hovercards/#fn:2\">2</a>. I also plan to modify the script so that it recognizes some special cases, such as <a href=\"https://indieweb.org/person_mention\">person mentions</a>, where populating the hovercard with H-Card data is appropriate, for example.</p>\n<p>Of course, I’d highly appreciate any comments, advice or thoughts on how to make these things better. For a work in progress, these are always welcome.</p>\n<p>As I was writing this post, I noticed that the first link (the one to <span class=\"h-card\"><a href=\"https://maggieappleton.com\" class=\"u-url\"><i></i> <span class=\"p-name\">Maggie Appleton</span></a></span>’s article) produces a hovercard with a nice cover image that is obviously autogenerated. Of course, I immediately wanted something like this for my posts that lack a cover image.</p>\n<p>Technically, the Open Graph protocol lists <code>og:image</code> as one of the <em>required</em> properties, meaning that every page should have one. Of course, finding a good (or even acceptable) cover image for every post can be too much hassle. There are three possible ways to deal with it: have a generic site-wide image for all the pages lacking their own images, have the images autogenerated, or have no image at all for some pages. The latter option violates the protocol, obviously, but it is used widely enough, and I also resorted to it until now.</p>\n<p>I asked around (in the <a href=\"https://matrix.to/#/!vRODLVURUpxrbkRiYp:matrix.org\">Russian IndieWeb chatroom</a>, naturally). The way most people (including Maggie) seem to go about it is by using <a href=\"https://playwright.dev/\">Playwright</a>, a headless browser developed for testing, to open the page and make a “screenshot”. This is a fascinating hack, but it doesn’t quite suit my workflow. I’ve also found <a href=\"https://github.com/Ladicle/tcardgen\">a piece of software</a> tailored specifically for Hugo, as well as some more general guidelines on how to generate cover images programmatically with JavaScript or Python. Those guidelines got me really thinking, and I ended up writing a Hugo template that generates a picture automatically for every page that doesn’t have a featured image.</p>\n<p>It works, although it, too, is very much a work in progress. Image processing in Hugo is somewhat limited, and also I’m not a very visual person, so these things are always hard for me. It’s currently a very simple script that only uses the site’s favicon, the author information and the page title, and it does (almost) nothing to adapt to the title’s length (so the text would sometimes overflow or look out of place). The good thing is, most of it can be fixed with time, and the script expanded to take into account more information about the page. Still, even as it is, it’s better than nothing, I think. At least every page does have <code>og:image</code> property now.</p>\n\n<ol><li>\n<p>I know I tend to abuse this feature sometimes. <a href=\"https://evgenykuznetsov.org/en/posts/2022/hovercards/#fnref:1\">↩︎</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>This I indeed implemented already. <a href=\"https://evgenykuznetsov.org/en/posts/2022/hovercards/#fnref:2\">↩︎</a></p>\n</li>\n</ol>",

I also plan to modify the script so that it recognizes some special cases, such as person mentions, where populating the hovercard with H-Card data is appropriate, for example.\nOf course, I’d highly appreciate any comments, advice or thoughts on how to make these things better. For a work in progress, these are always welcome.\nAs I was writing this post, I noticed that the first link (the one to  Maggie Appleton’s article) produces a hovercard with a nice cover image that is obviously autogenerated. Of course, I immediately wanted something like this for my posts that lack a cover image.\nTechnically, the Open Graph protocol lists og:image as one of the required properties, meaning that every page should have one. Of course, finding a good (or even acceptable) cover image for every post can be too much hassle. There are three possible ways to deal with it: have a generic site-wide image for all the pages lacking their own images, have the images autogenerated, or have no image at all for some pages. The latter option violates the protocol, obviously, but it is used widely enough, and I also resorted to it until now.\nI asked around (in the Russian IndieWeb chatroom, naturally). The way most people (including Maggie) seem to go about it is by using Playwright, a headless browser developed for testing, to open the page and make a “screenshot”. This is a fascinating hack, but it doesn’t quite suit my workflow. I’ve also found a piece of software tailored specifically for Hugo, as well as some more general guidelines on how to generate cover images programmatically with JavaScript or Python. Those guidelines got me really thinking, and I ended up writing a Hugo template that generates a picture automatically for every page that doesn’t have a featured image.\nIt works, although it, too, is very much a work in progress. Image processing in Hugo is somewhat limited, and also I’m not a very visual person, so these things are always hard for me. It’s currently a very simple script that only uses the site’s favicon, the author information and the page title, and it does (almost) nothing to adapt to the title’s length (so the text would sometimes overflow or look out of place). The good thing is, most of it can be fixed with time, and the script expanded to take into account more information about the page. Still, even as it is, it’s better than nothing, I think. At least every page does have og:image property now.\n\n\nI know I tend to abuse this feature sometimes. ↩︎\n\n\nThis I indeed implemented already. ↩︎"

        "text": "Мысль сделать на этом сайте всплывающие карточки на ссылках поселилась в моей голове уже довольно давно. От воплощения этой мысли в жизнь меня удерживали некоторые соображения (не в последнюю очередь — отсутствие нужных знаний и умений), но в конце концов оно, воплощение, состоялось.\nПодтолкнула меня концепция видимых ссылок, которая показалась мне очень здравой. Как справедливо упоминает эта статья, в Википедии всплывающие карточки сделали не просто так. Я, конечно, далёк от мысли, что мой сайт можно сравнивать с Википедией, но сама идея дать читателю больше контекста с меньшими затратами весьма привлекательна, правда?\nОдна из тех причин, по которым я до сих пор за всплывающие карточки не брался — мобильные устройства. На тач-скрине всплывающие карточки лишены смысла, а мне не хотелось делать на сайте что-то, чем нельзя будет пользоваться на телефоне или планшете. Не то, чтобы я был поклонником концепции «mobile first», скорее наоборот, но я всячески пытаюсь, работая над своим сайтом, не забывать и про мобильные устройства. Правда, интерфейсом gitweb на мобильном тоже не шибко удобно пользоваться, ну так и смысла пользоваться им на мобильном, откровенно говоря, немного, так что пусть уж будет. Википедия, опять таки, всплывающих карточек на мобильном не показывает; можно брать пример, пожалуй.\nСо всеми этими мыслями я на этой неделе засучил рукава и открыл VSCodium. Очень помогло, что  capjamesg как раз недавно сделал всю сложную часть (знаю, знаю, надо взяться-таки за JavaScript), так что мне осталась интересная. Понятно, что я не использую такой же бэкенд, как у Джеймса, и с этим пришлось как раз разбираться самому.\nОткуда, собственно, брать информацию для всплывающей карточки? Логичнее всего — с самой страницы, на которую ссылка. По причинам, о которых я уже писал, собирать эту информацию и хранить у себя, как это делает Джеймс — не моё, так что очевидным решением стал снова indieweb-glue. Понятно, пришлось сначала научить его возвращать информацию о страницах (а не только о людях). Брать же информацию на страницах было решено, для начала, из Open Graph protocol, благо он широко распространён, и на многих страницах в Сети соответствующие мета-тэги есть.\nВ indieweb-glue я добавил обработку этих мета-тэгов (заодно пришлось немного отрефакторить код), а скрипт Джеймса немного переделал, чтобы он забирал информацию из indieweb-glue. Заодно научил скрипт работать с заранее определённым классом, а не просто с <article>, — так удобнее контролировать, где всплывающие карточки нужны, а где лучше без них. Добавил щепотку CSS, и всё заработало вполне удовлетворительно. Признаюсь, сам удивился.\nПриятным бонусом стало то, что можно использовать этот же скрипт, чтобы «на лету» делать всплывающие карточки для сносок1; пожалуй, это меня порадовало ещё больше. Сноски меня вообще давно нервировали. С одной стороны, это — замечательный инструмент в арсенале писателя, незаменимый для сохранения плавности изложения без отвлечений и уводов от темы. С другой — в цифровом мире текст сноски сплошь и рядом оказывается за пределами экрана, и перемотка или переход по ссылке обычно чересчур сбивают с мысли. На бумаге-то достаточно просто посмотреть вниз; человек достаточно хорошо справляется с задачей возврата взгляда обратно в текст, чтобы просмотр сноски не сильно отвлекал от чтения. Возможность увидеть текст сноски во всплывающей карточке, кажется, — неплохой компромисс.\nТо, что получилось, пока далеко от идеала. Надо допилить CSS, а то карточки не всегда опрятно выглядят, особенно если картинка вертикальная. indieweb-glue надо научить брать информацию не только из Open Graph protocol; например, у страниц Википедии нет og:description, зато первый абзац самого текста — явно именно то, что должно быть в карточке2. В планах и доработка скрипта: было бы здорово научить его распознавать особые случаи, и, например, для person mentions заполнять карточку данными из H-Card.\nНу и, поскольку работа продолжается, за любые комментарии, советы и мысли о том, как лучше всё организовать, я буду очень признателен.\nПока писал этот пост, заметил, что для первой ссылки (та, что на статью  Мэгги Эпплтон) в карточке появляется нарядная картинка-обложка, сгенерированная, очевидно, автоматически. Я, разумеется, немедленно захотел себе что-то подобное для страниц, на которых нет «основной» картинки.\nВообще говоря, протокол Open Graph говорит, что свойство og:image — обязательное, то есть должно быть у каждой страницы. Конечно, искать для каждого поста (не говоря уж о твитоподобных заметках) подходящую (или хотя бы примерно годную) картинку слишком хлопотно. У этой проблемы есть три возможных решения: можно завести общую картинку для всего сайта, и ставить её «обложкой» на страницы, где своей картинки нет; можно генерировать картинки-обложки автоматически; наконец, можно просто плюнуть и на (значительной) части страниц не иметь картинки вовсе. Собственно, последний вариант нарушает протокол, но весьма распространён, и на моём сайте тоже до последнего времени использовался именно он.\nЯ поспрашивал (в чате русскоязычного индивеба, само собой). Судя по всему, большинство (включая Мэгги) пользуется «безголовым» браузером Playwright, разработанным для тестирования, чтобы автоматически открыть страницу и сделать её «скриншот» (который и становится картинкой-обложкой). Подход, надо признать, изобретательный, но к тому, как всё устроено у меня, не очень применимый. При дальнейшем погружении в тему нашлись специально для Hugo разработанная утилита, а также изрядное количество инструкций по созданию таких изображений средствами JavaScript или Python. Инструкции, наконец, подтолкнули меня подумать головой, и в итоге я написал шаблон, который создаёт картинку автоматически для каждой странице, на которой «обложки» не хватает, прямо средствами самого Hugo.\nРаботает, хотя и в этом случае, конечно, доделок предстоит ещё много. Возможности обработки изображений в Hugo не безграничны, да к тому же меня очень сложно назвать «визуалом», и такие вещи всегда даются мне тяжело. Пока у меня совсем простенький скрипт, в котором задействованы только иконка сайта, информация об авторе и заголовок страницы, и нет никакого3 механизма, учитывающего длину заголовка, поэтому текст то и дело выезжает за пределы картинки или, наоборот, выглядит мелковато.

В любом случае, то, что получилось, лучше, чем ничего. По крайней мере, теперь на каждой странице есть свойство og:image — уже немало.\n\n\nЯ иногда сносками злоупотребляю. ↩︎\n\n\nUpd: Это я прикрутил на следующий день. ↩︎\n\n\nUpd: Механизм появился, но он очень простенький, и не всегда справляется. ↩︎"

      "name": "Building A Second Brain: обзор метода ведения заметок Тиаго Форте",
      "content": {
        "html": "<p><a href=\"https://buildingasecondbrain.com\">Building A Second Brain</a> — это метод ведения цифровых заметок, который разработал и продвигает американец Тиаго Форте. В 2022 году Тиаго выпустил <a href=\"https://www.buildingasecondbrain.com/book\">книгу</a> с таким же названием. Судя по ажиотажу, который она вызвала в PKM-сообществе, эта книга обещает стать такой же популярной, как «<a href=\"https://www.mann-ivanov-ferber.ru/books/kak-delat-poleznye-zametki/\">Как делать полезные заметки</a>» Зонке Аренса.</p>\n\n\n\n<span></span>\n\n\n\n<p>Метод Тиаго, сокращённо BASB, очень известен в среде энтузиастов управления знаниями и ведения заметок. Тиаго ведёт курс по своему методу, и за несколько лет курс прошли несколько тысяч человек.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Не смотря на то, что Тиаго ведёт речь в основном о заметках, его подход годится для организации всего цифрового контента: фотографий, документов, ПДФ-файлов и так далее.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>В этой статье расскажу, что из себя представляет метод Building A Second Brain. Основные источники для статьи — книга Тиаго, его рассылка, а также блог, Ютуб-канал и даже Твиттер.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>История создания BASB</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Тиаго начал вести заметки не от хорошей жизни. Когда ему было 22 года и он учился в колледже, у него развилась редкая болезнь, которая сопровождалась мучительными болями в горле. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Никто из врачей, к которым обращался Тиаго, не могли не то чтобы предложить лечение, но и даже понять причину заболевания. И тогда Тиаго начал действовать самостоятельно. Он взял из клиники свою историю болезни и организовал все записи из неё по датам, врачам и их специализациям.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Потом он стал собирать записи о своём самочувствии, методах лечения, которые пробовал, и свои впечатления от них.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>За несколько лет Тиаго собрал большую коллекцию заметок на тему своей болезни. Он не смог полностью вылечиться, но разработал десяток ежедневных практик для горла и связок, специальные упражнения, которые облегчают его боль. Так он смог жить полной жизнью.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Этот же подход в ведении заметок Тиаго применил, когда стал работать в большой компании из «Кремниевой долины».</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Коллеги стали обращать внимание на способность Тиаго помнить все важные идеи и мысли, вплоть до того, что обсуждалось на рабочей встрече в прошлом месяце.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Люди интересовались методом Тиаго, а он учил их вести заметки. Тогда он подумал, что это может стать делом его жизни.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Так и получилось.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Что такое Second Brain</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>«Второй мозг» — это в принципе любая система для хранения важной информации. Даже если вы просто записываете свои идеи в бумажный блокнот или Заметки Apple — это тоже «второй мозг».</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Тиаго предлагает свой особый подход к созданию и организации «второго мозга», который он и назвал Building A Second Brain.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>В первую очередь, «второй мозг» — это место для хранения заметок. В своей книге Тиаго говорит, что главная задача BASB — это эффективное управление информацией и знаниями, а знания начинаются с простой практики ведения заметок. И поэтому, не смотря на то, что Second Brain — это система из нескольких разных и взаимосвязанных инструментов, центральное место в методологии Тиаго занимают приложения для ведения заметок.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Сам он долгое время пользуется Evernote, но подойдёт практически любой другой заметочник: Obsidian, Notion, Roam, Nota, Заметки Apple или даже Google Keep.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>CODE — как построить «второй мозг»</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Процесс построения «второго мозга» состоит из четырёх простых этапов: сбор, организация, обработка и использование информации. Тиаго назвал этот метод CODE, по первым буквам слов: Capture — сбор, Organize — организация, Distill — уточнение и Express — высказывание.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Capture.</strong> Первый шаг — собрать всю интересную информации и идеи в одном месте.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Organize.</strong> Самый важный, на мой взгляд, этап — организовать свои заметки так, чтобы их потом можно было найти в нужный момент. Даже если пренебречь следующими двумя пунктами, после организации заметками можно более чем эффективно пользоваться.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Distill.</strong> После того, как полезная информация собрана и организована, нужно позаботиться о том, чтобы её можно было легко пересматривать спустя некоторое время. Информацию желательно не просто собирать в одном месте, но и пропустить через сито своих соображений, противоположных мнений и личного опыта.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Express.</strong> Полученные знания не должны лежать мёртвым грузом. Их надо использовать. Речь идёт не только о статьях или книгах, но о любом другом способе выражения. Это может быть прорывная идея маркетингового продвижения продукта, решение сложной задачи на производстве или изменение подхода к продажам в своём отделе. На этом этапе единичные мысли и идеи комбинируются, создавая что-то новое.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Дальше о каждом этапе поподробнее.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Как правильно собирать информацию во «второй мозг»</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Первый этап наполнения «второго мозга» — это сбор информации и идей. Может показаться, что этот шаг очень простой, но такое впечатление обманчиво.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Из-за ошибок на этапе сбора могут возникнуть сложности дальше по цепочке развития всей системы заметок. Тиаго, в этом контексте, сравнивает заметки с садом. Урожай в нём зависит не только от того, как ухаживать, но и от того, что ты посадишь в своём саду. Как говорится, что посеешь, то и пожнёшь.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Невозможно собрать всю информацию, которая попадается на глаза. И поэтому стоит определиться заранее, что собирать в свой «второй мозг».</p>\n\n\n\n<p>На первый взгляд самым правильным критерием может быть полезность той или иной информации. Однако, значение и значимость многих идей, информации, историй иногда невозможно определить при первой встрече. Как узнать наверняка, что эта идея или цитата из книги пригодится нам в будущем? Ведь мы порой и понятия не имеем, что нам будет интересно через год или два.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Принимать такое решение при встрече с каждой единицей информации может быть слишком утомительно для мозга и затратно по времени.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ты листаешь Твиттер и тебе попалась ссылка на статью какого-то Фёдорова, который пишет, о BASB. Статья полезная? Нужная? Надо открыть, прочитать, чтобы понять, стоит ли сохранить её и вернуться к ней позже. Ок, определился, сохранил. И так с каждой следующей статьёй, твитом, видео? Невозможно!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Тиаго предлагает другой фильтр — сохранять то, что показалось интересным. В книге он сформулировал это так —  «Keep What Resonates», сохраняй что резонирует.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>В этом Тиаго солидарен с Ником Майло и его <a href=\"https://fedorovpishet.ru/noma/\">NoMa методом</a>. «Хм, это интересно» — первый этап метода Ника. Сохраняйте всё, что привлекает внимание, вызывает интерес, кажется важным.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Отдельное внимание надо уделить выбору инструмента для сбора. Мысли, идеи, информация могут поступать из десятка разных источников. Заметки, фото, ПДФ-файлы, голосовые заметки, сообщения, ссылки, электронные книги и письма, видео и много чего ещё. Поэтому лучше, чтобы в приложении для заметок было как можно больше вариантов для сбора информации.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Мне кажется, что Тиаго именно по этой причине использует Evernote. В него можно сохранять текстовые и голосовые заметки, файлы, фото, есть веб-клиппер для браузера. Навскидку я не могу вспомнить ни одного другого инструмента с такими возможностями. Даже Notion немного уступает — в нём нельзя делать голосовые заметки.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Важный принцип сбора — это сохранять всё в одном месте. Какое бы хорошее приложение мы не выбрали, не получится ограничится только одним. Пометки в электронных и бумажных книгах, записи в диктофоне, заметки от руки, сохранённые твиты и сообщения в мессенджерах — все эти места стоит регулярно пересматривать и переносить контент в заметочник.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>PARA — сортируй заметки по назначению</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>PARA — это самая известная и обсуждаемая часть метода Тиаго Форте. Он назвал так свою систему организации заметок.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Главный принцип этого метода — сортировать заметки не по источнику, теме или типу информации, а по назначению. Тиаго написал «for Actionability» и, как это часто бывает, в русском языке нет достаточно близкого по смыслу слова для перевода.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>PARA состоит из четырёх основных категорий: Projects — проекты, Areas — области, Resources — ресурсы, и Archives — архивы. Это универсальные категории, которые подойдут для любой информации.</p>\n\n\n\nПринцип PARA очень хорошо иллюстрирует эта картинка от <a href=\"https://maggieappleton.com/basb\">Мэгги Эпплтон</a><p><strong>Проекты.</strong> Это некая задача с определённым сроком, над которой работаешь в настоящий момент и у которой должен быть некий результат. Проект проще всего определить, и заметки для этой категории легко сортировать.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Например, у меня самый частый вариант проекта — это тексты для блога, канала или по работе. Тиаго приводит такие примеры проектов: спроектировать дизайн веб-страницы, пройти курс, спланировать отпуск, написать пост и другие.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Области.</strong> Это категория более высокого порядка. Область — важная сфера нашей жизни, которую надо постоянно поддерживать на определённом уровне. У неё нет ни начала, ни конца, как у проекта — так их проще всего отличить друг от друга.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Пример моих Областей: Семья, Продуктивность, Блог, Заметки, Чтение, Pyrus — компания, в которой я работаю. Тиаго приводит в примет такие: Машина, Путешествия, Здоровье, Саморазвитие и тому подобные.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Ресурсы.</strong> Эта категория схожа с Областями. Тиаго даёт такое определение — ресурсы включают в себя темы, которые тебе интересны, но не подходят ни в Проекты, ни в Области.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Некоторые примеры, которые он приводит в книге, похожи на Области: Дизайн интерьеров, Заметки, Кофе, Аниме. Отличие от Областей в том, что эти темы представляют интерес, но это не то, что актуально прямо сейчас.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Так как Тиаго многое взял из GTD Дэвида Аллена, я бы провёл параллель со списками Может быть/Когда-нибудь. Можно представить Ресурсы эдакой библиотекой полезных ссылок и источников по темам, которые, возможно, пригодятся в будущем.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Например, я мечтаю писать художественную прозу, поэтому у меня есть категория Писательство. Здесь я собираю заметки и источники о писательстве. Но в ближайшее время я не собираюсь писать ни рассказов, ни романа. Поэтому Писательство лежит в Ресурсах, а не в Области.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Архивы.</strong> И последняя категория — в которую попадают заметки из выше перечисленных категорий, которые больше не нужны или не актуальны. Например, в эту папку могут попадать завершённые проекты или даже Области, которые больше не важны — такое может случиться при смене работы.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Важная особенность такого разделения — заметки, файлы и целые разделы не зафиксированы навечно. Их можно перемещать. Проект может превратиться в Область и наоборот. Допустим, ты собирал заметки о дизайне, а потом решил написать об этом книгу или выпускать обучающую рассылку.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Или вот моя папка Писательство. Пока это Ресурс, но со временем я перенесу её в Области. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>В книге Тиаго демонстрирует скриншоты своих заметок в Evernote. Эти скриншоты лучше всяких слов объясняют принцип PARA.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Так выглядят папки в блокноте Тиаго.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Папка Проекты включает 11 папок с заметками в каждой: от всего двух до двух сотен, как в проекте «BASB manuscript».</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Вот пример заметок из папки проекта по созданию домашней студии в гараже.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Так выглядят Области. Те из них, что относятся к бизнесу Тиаго, помечены буквами FL — Forte Labs, чтобы они были всегда рядом. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Пример заметок в Области Здоровье.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>А вот папка Ресурсы с перечнем интересов Тиаго.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>В папке Архив больше всего папок.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Важный принцип PARA — этому методу необходимо следовать не только в заметочнике, но и во всех других приложениях и инструментах. Вот, например, как иллюстрирует этот принцип один из менторов BASB, сравнивая заметочник, таск-менеджер и облачное хранилище.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Чтобы определиться, в какую категорию лучше всего поместить ту или иную заметку, Тиаго советует задать себе несколько вопросов.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>В каком проекте эта заметка будет наиболее полезна? Если ни в каком, то в какой области она будет наиболее полезна? Если ни в какой, то в какому ресурсу она должна относиться? И вот если и тут никакому, то просто помещаем заметку в архив.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Progressive Summarization — докопаться до сути</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Важный критерий собранных заметок — это читабельность. Тиаго использует другой термин — «discoverability». Его смысл — насколько легко понять, что написано в заметке, её главный смысл.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Чем больше заметок собирается во «втором мозге», тем больше времени и усилий требуется, чтобы их пересматривать и перечитывать. Поэтому заметки нужно делать таким способом, чтобы можно было тратить как можно меньше времени на их обзор.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Для решения это проблемы Тиаго придумал технику прогрессивного конспектирования. Чтобы улучшить читабельность заметок, он предлагает выработать простую привычку, которую многие помнят ещё по школе — подчёркивать самые важные места.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Техника очень простая. Ты выделяешь главные места в заметке, потом выделяешь главные места в этих пометках, и так далее. На каждом новом уровне нужно использовать разные виды форматирования, чтобы их было легко отличить друг от друга.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Вот как это работает, на примере одной статьи. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Сначала Тиаго сохраняет в заметке несколько отрывков из заинтересовавшей его статьи. Получается небольшой конспект. Это первый уровень конспектирования.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Он не сохраняет всю статью. В тексте заметки Тиаго указывает ссылку на источник. Так что, если ему нужно будет уточнить детали, он сможет перейти по ссылке и перечитать статью заново.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>На втором уровне он выделяет жирным шрифтом главные идеи в получившемся тексте заметки.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>На следующем уровне он пересматривает выделенное жирным и помечает в этих местах только самое интересное и важное.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Он рекомендует использовать инструмент выделения маркером, который есть почти в каждом заметочнике. Если такой опции нет, можно использовать курсив или подчёркивание.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Таким образом можно быстро окинуть заметку взглядом и понять, о чём этот текст. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Только для самых уникальных и полезных источников Тиаго добавляет саммари. В начале страницы он составляет список главных идей. Он рекомендует использовать маркированный список, чтобы был проще читать, и писать своими словами.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Метод прогрессивного конспектирования можно использовать не только для статей, но и для других типов контента: книг, видео, подкастов, лекций и так далее.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Тиаго советует не увлекаться подчёркиванием. Надо помнить, что главная цель прогрессивного конспектирования — это возможность быстро пересмотреть текст заметки и сразу понять суть. Поэтому он рекомендует, чтобы каждый следующий уровень пометок содержал не больше 10-20 процентов от предыдущего.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Покажи свою работу</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Последний этап CODE — это самое главное, для чего вообще всё начиналось: использование.

        "text": "Building A Second Brain — это метод ведения цифровых заметок, который разработал и продвигает американец Тиаго Форте. В 2022 году Тиаго выпустил книгу с таким же названием. Судя по ажиотажу, который она вызвала в PKM-сообществе, эта книга обещает стать такой же популярной, как «Как делать полезные заметки» Зонке Аренса.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nМетод Тиаго, сокращённо BASB, очень известен в среде энтузиастов управления знаниями и ведения заметок. Тиаго ведёт курс по своему методу, и за несколько лет курс прошли несколько тысяч человек.\n\n\n\nНе смотря на то, что Тиаго ведёт речь в основном о заметках, его подход годится для организации всего цифрового контента: фотографий, документов, ПДФ-файлов и так далее.\n\n\n\nВ этой статье расскажу, что из себя представляет метод Building A Second Brain. Основные источники для статьи — книга Тиаго, его рассылка, а также блог, Ютуб-канал и даже Твиттер.\n\n\n\nИстория создания BASB\n\n\n\nТиаго начал вести заметки не от хорошей жизни. Когда ему было 22 года и он учился в колледже, у него развилась редкая болезнь, которая сопровождалась мучительными болями в горле. \n\n\n\nНикто из врачей, к которым обращался Тиаго, не могли не то чтобы предложить лечение, но и даже понять причину заболевания. И тогда Тиаго начал действовать самостоятельно. Он взял из клиники свою историю болезни и организовал все записи из неё по датам, врачам и их специализациям.\n\n\n\nПотом он стал собирать записи о своём самочувствии, методах лечения, которые пробовал, и свои впечатления от них.\n\n\n\nЗа несколько лет Тиаго собрал большую коллекцию заметок на тему своей болезни. Он не смог полностью вылечиться, но разработал десяток ежедневных практик для горла и связок, специальные упражнения, которые облегчают его боль. Так он смог жить полной жизнью.\n\n\n\nЭтот же подход в ведении заметок Тиаго применил, когда стал работать в большой компании из «Кремниевой долины».\n\n\n\nКоллеги стали обращать внимание на способность Тиаго помнить все важные идеи и мысли, вплоть до того, что обсуждалось на рабочей встрече в прошлом месяце.\n\n\n\nЛюди интересовались методом Тиаго, а он учил их вести заметки. Тогда он подумал, что это может стать делом его жизни.\n\n\n\nТак и получилось.\n\n\n\nЧто такое Second Brain\n\n\n\n«Второй мозг» — это в принципе любая система для хранения важной информации. Даже если вы просто записываете свои идеи в бумажный блокнот или Заметки Apple — это тоже «второй мозг».\n\n\n\nТиаго предлагает свой особый подход к созданию и организации «второго мозга», который он и назвал Building A Second Brain.\n\n\n\nВ первую очередь, «второй мозг» — это место для хранения заметок. В своей книге Тиаго говорит, что главная задача BASB — это эффективное управление информацией и знаниями, а знания начинаются с простой практики ведения заметок. И поэтому, не смотря на то, что Second Brain — это система из нескольких разных и взаимосвязанных инструментов, центральное место в методологии Тиаго занимают приложения для ведения заметок.\n\n\n\nСам он долгое время пользуется Evernote, но подойдёт практически любой другой заметочник: Obsidian, Notion, Roam, Nota, Заметки Apple или даже Google Keep.\n\n\n\nCODE — как построить «второй мозг»\n\n\n\nПроцесс построения «второго мозга» состоит из четырёх простых этапов: сбор, организация, обработка и использование информации. Тиаго назвал этот метод CODE, по первым буквам слов: Capture — сбор, Organize — организация, Distill — уточнение и Express — высказывание.\n\n\n\nCapture. Первый шаг — собрать всю интересную информации и идеи в одном месте.\n\n\n\nOrganize. Самый важный, на мой взгляд, этап — организовать свои заметки так, чтобы их потом можно было найти в нужный момент. Даже если пренебречь следующими двумя пунктами, после организации заметками можно более чем эффективно пользоваться.\n\n\n\nDistill. После того, как полезная информация собрана и организована, нужно позаботиться о том, чтобы её можно было легко пересматривать спустя некоторое время. Информацию желательно не просто собирать в одном месте, но и пропустить через сито своих соображений, противоположных мнений и личного опыта.\n\n\n\nExpress. Полученные знания не должны лежать мёртвым грузом. Их надо использовать. Речь идёт не только о статьях или книгах, но о любом другом способе выражения. Это может быть прорывная идея маркетингового продвижения продукта, решение сложной задачи на производстве или изменение подхода к продажам в своём отделе. На этом этапе единичные мысли и идеи комбинируются, создавая что-то новое.\n\n\n\nДальше о каждом этапе поподробнее.\n\n\n\nКак правильно собирать информацию во «второй мозг»\n\n\n\nПервый этап наполнения «второго мозга» — это сбор информации и идей. Может показаться, что этот шаг очень простой, но такое впечатление обманчиво.\n\n\n\nИз-за ошибок на этапе сбора могут возникнуть сложности дальше по цепочке развития всей системы заметок. Тиаго, в этом контексте, сравнивает заметки с садом. Урожай в нём зависит не только от того, как ухаживать, но и от того, что ты посадишь в своём саду. Как говорится, что посеешь, то и пожнёшь.\n\n\n\nНевозможно собрать всю информацию, которая попадается на глаза. И поэтому стоит определиться заранее, что собирать в свой «второй мозг».\n\n\n\nНа первый взгляд самым правильным критерием может быть полезность той или иной информации. Однако, значение и значимость многих идей, информации, историй иногда невозможно определить при первой встрече. Как узнать наверняка, что эта идея или цитата из книги пригодится нам в будущем? Ведь мы порой и понятия не имеем, что нам будет интересно через год или два.\n\n\n\nПринимать такое решение при встрече с каждой единицей информации может быть слишком утомительно для мозга и затратно по времени.\n\n\n\nТы листаешь Твиттер и тебе попалась ссылка на статью какого-то Фёдорова, который пишет, о BASB. Статья полезная? Нужная? Надо открыть, прочитать, чтобы понять, стоит ли сохранить её и вернуться к ней позже. Ок, определился, сохранил. И так с каждой следующей статьёй, твитом, видео? Невозможно!\n\n\n\nТиаго предлагает другой фильтр — сохранять то, что показалось интересным. В книге он сформулировал это так —  «Keep What Resonates», сохраняй что резонирует.\n\n\n\nВ этом Тиаго солидарен с Ником Майло и его NoMa методом. «Хм, это интересно» — первый этап метода Ника. Сохраняйте всё, что привлекает внимание, вызывает интерес, кажется важным.\n\n\n\nОтдельное внимание надо уделить выбору инструмента для сбора. Мысли, идеи, информация могут поступать из десятка разных источников. Заметки, фото, ПДФ-файлы, голосовые заметки, сообщения, ссылки, электронные книги и письма, видео и много чего ещё. Поэтому лучше, чтобы в приложении для заметок было как можно больше вариантов для сбора информации.\n\n\n\nМне кажется, что Тиаго именно по этой причине использует Evernote. В него можно сохранять текстовые и голосовые заметки, файлы, фото, есть веб-клиппер для браузера. Навскидку я не могу вспомнить ни одного другого инструмента с такими возможностями. Даже Notion немного уступает — в нём нельзя делать голосовые заметки.\n\n\n\nВажный принцип сбора — это сохранять всё в одном месте. Какое бы хорошее приложение мы не выбрали, не получится ограничится только одним. Пометки в электронных и бумажных книгах, записи в диктофоне, заметки от руки, сохранённые твиты и сообщения в мессенджерах — все эти места стоит регулярно пересматривать и переносить контент в заметочник.\n\n\n\nPARA — сортируй заметки по назначению\n\n\n\nPARA — это самая известная и обсуждаемая часть метода Тиаго Форте. Он назвал так свою систему организации заметок.\n\n\n\nГлавный принцип этого метода — сортировать заметки не по источнику, теме или типу информации, а по назначению. Тиаго написал «for Actionability» и, как это часто бывает, в русском языке нет достаточно близкого по смыслу слова для перевода.\n\n\n\nPARA состоит из четырёх основных категорий: Projects — проекты, Areas — области, Resources — ресурсы, и Archives — архивы. Это универсальные категории, которые подойдут для любой информации.\n\n\n\nПринцип PARA очень хорошо иллюстрирует эта картинка от Мэгги ЭпплтонПроекты. Это некая задача с определённым сроком, над которой работаешь в настоящий момент и у которой должен быть некий результат. Проект проще всего определить, и заметки для этой категории легко сортировать.\n\n\n\nНапример, у меня самый частый вариант проекта — это тексты для блога, канала или по работе. Тиаго приводит такие примеры проектов: спроектировать дизайн веб-страницы, пройти курс, спланировать отпуск, написать пост и другие.\n\n\n\nОбласти. Это категория более высокого порядка. Область — важная сфера нашей жизни, которую надо постоянно поддерживать на определённом уровне. У неё нет ни начала, ни конца, как у проекта — так их проще всего отличить друг от друга.\n\n\n\nПример моих Областей: Семья, Продуктивность, Блог, Заметки, Чтение, Pyrus — компания, в которой я работаю. Тиаго приводит в примет такие: Машина, Путешествия, Здоровье, Саморазвитие и тому подобные.\n\n\n\nРесурсы. Эта категория схожа с Областями. Тиаго даёт такое определение — ресурсы включают в себя темы, которые тебе интересны, но не подходят ни в Проекты, ни в Области.\n\n\n\nНекоторые примеры, которые он приводит в книге, похожи на Области: Дизайн интерьеров, Заметки, Кофе, Аниме. Отличие от Областей в том, что эти темы представляют интерес, но это не то, что актуально прямо сейчас.\n\n\n\nТак как Тиаго многое взял из GTD Дэвида Аллена, я бы провёл параллель со списками Может быть/Когда-нибудь. Можно представить Ресурсы эдакой библиотекой полезных ссылок и источников по темам, которые, возможно, пригодятся в будущем.\n\n\n\nНапример, я мечтаю писать художественную прозу, поэтому у меня есть категория Писательство. Здесь я собираю заметки и источники о писательстве. Но в ближайшее время я не собираюсь писать ни рассказов, ни романа. Поэтому Писательство лежит в Ресурсах, а не в Области.\n\n\n\nАрхивы. И последняя категория — в которую попадают заметки из выше перечисленных категорий, которые больше не нужны или не актуальны. Например, в эту папку могут попадать завершённые проекты или даже Области, которые больше не важны — такое может случиться при смене работы.\n\n\n\nВажная особенность такого разделения — заметки, файлы и целые разделы не зафиксированы навечно. Их можно перемещать. Проект может превратиться в Область и наоборот. Допустим, ты собирал заметки о дизайне, а потом решил написать об этом книгу или выпускать обучающую рассылку.\n\n\n\nИли вот моя папка Писательство. Пока это Ресурс, но со временем я перенесу её в Области. \n\n\n\nВ книге Тиаго демонстрирует скриншоты своих заметок в Evernote. Эти скриншоты лучше всяких слов объясняют принцип PARA.\n\n\n\nТак выглядят папки в блокноте Тиаго.\n\n\n\nПапка Проекты включает 11 папок с заметками в каждой: от всего двух до двух сотен, как в проекте «BASB manuscript».\n\n\n\nВот пример заметок из папки проекта по созданию домашней студии в гараже.\n\n\n\nТак выглядят Области. Те из них, что относятся к бизнесу Тиаго, помечены буквами FL — Forte Labs, чтобы они были всегда рядом. \n\n\n\nПример заметок в Области Здоровье.\n\n\n\nА вот папка Ресурсы с перечнем интересов Тиаго.\n\n\n\nВ папке Архив больше всего папок.\n\n\n\nВажный принцип PARA — этому методу необходимо следовать не только в заметочнике, но и во всех других приложениях и инструментах. Вот, например, как иллюстрирует этот принцип один из менторов BASB, сравнивая заметочник, таск-менеджер и облачное хранилище.\n\n\n\nЧтобы определиться, в какую категорию лучше всего поместить ту или иную заметку, Тиаго советует задать себе несколько вопросов.\n\n\n\nВ каком проекте эта заметка будет наиболее полезна? Если ни в каком, то в какой области она будет наиболее полезна? Если ни в какой, то в какому ресурсу она должна относиться? И вот если и тут никакому, то просто помещаем заметку в архив.\n\n\n\nProgressive Summarization — докопаться до сути\n\n\n\nВажный критерий собранных заметок — это читабельность. Тиаго использует другой термин — «discoverability». Его смысл — насколько легко понять, что написано в заметке, её главный смысл.\n\n\n\nЧем больше заметок собирается во «втором мозге», тем больше времени и усилий требуется, чтобы их пересматривать и перечитывать. Поэтому заметки нужно делать таким способом, чтобы можно было тратить как можно меньше времени на их обзор.\n\n\n\nДля решения это проблемы Тиаго придумал технику прогрессивного конспектирования. Чтобы улучшить читабельность заметок, он предлагает выработать простую привычку, которую многие помнят ещё по школе — подчёркивать самые важные места.\n\n\n\nТехника очень простая. Ты выделяешь главные места в заметке, потом выделяешь главные места в этих пометках, и так далее. На каждом новом уровне нужно использовать разные виды форматирования, чтобы их было легко отличить друг от друга.\n\n\n\nВот как это работает, на примере одной статьи. \n\n\n\nСначала Тиаго сохраняет в заметке несколько отрывков из заинтересовавшей его статьи. Получается небольшой конспект. Это первый уровень конспектирования.\n\n\n\nОн не сохраняет всю статью. В тексте заметки Тиаго указывает ссылку на источник. Так что, если ему нужно будет уточнить детали, он сможет перейти по ссылке и перечитать статью заново.\n\n\n\nНа втором уровне он выделяет жирным шрифтом главные идеи в получившемся тексте заметки.\n\n\n\nНа следующем уровне он пересматривает выделенное жирным и помечает в этих местах только самое интересное и важное.\n\n\n\nОн рекомендует использовать инструмент выделения маркером, который есть почти в каждом заметочнике. Если такой опции нет, можно использовать курсив или подчёркивание.\n\n\n\nТаким образом можно быстро окинуть заметку взглядом и понять, о чём этот текст. \n\n\n\nТолько для самых уникальных и полезных источников Тиаго добавляет саммари. В начале страницы он составляет список главных идей. Он рекомендует использовать маркированный список, чтобы был проще читать, и писать своими словами.\n\n\n\nМетод прогрессивного конспектирования можно использовать не только для статей, но и для других типов контента: книг, видео, подкастов, лекций и так далее.\n\n\n\nТиаго советует не увлекаться подчёркиванием. Надо помнить, что главная цель прогрессивного конспектирования — это возможность быстро пересмотреть текст заметки и сразу понять суть. Поэтому он рекомендует, чтобы каждый следующий уровень пометок содержал не больше 10-20 процентов от предыдущего.\n\n\n\nПокажи свою работу\n\n\n\nПоследний этап CODE — это самое главное, для чего вообще всё начиналось: использование. Главная задача ведь не в том, чтобы собирать заметки, а чтобы они приносили пользу и помогали в работе и жизни.\n\n\n\nТиаго пишет, что многие часто концентрируются только на финальном результате, а все промежуточные материалы просто выбрасывают: черновики, наброски, планы, заметки со встреч. Но так не должно быть.\n\n\n\nИнформация во «втором мозге» должна стать строительным материалом для будущих работ. Каждая заметка может стать кирпичиком следующего проекта.\n\n\n\nСмысл в том, чтобы не начинать новый проект каждый раз с чистого листа, а использовать записи из «второго мозга».\n\n\n\nТиаго называет такие «кирпичики» промежуточными блоками — Intermediate Packets, и выделяет пять их типов:\n\n\n\nОбработанные заметки. Для своих проектов можно брать информацию из книг и статей, которые ты обработал с помощью метода прогрессивного конспектирования.\n\n\n\nНеудачные заметки. Материалы или идеи, которые не вошли в прошлый проект, можно использовать в следующих. Тиаго говорит, что не удаляет куски, которые не вошли в итоговый вариант его статей для блога, а сохраняет их.\n\n\n\nСправочные материалы. Документы, графики, планы прошлых проектов тоже можно использовать не один раз. В книге он приводит в пример использование плана прошедшей конференции для подготовки к новой.\n\n\n\nГотовые проекты. Куски из одного проекта можно использовать в другом.\n\n\n\nДокументы, которые делали другие. Это могут быть идеи и работы коллег или клиентов.\nТиаго советует всегда цитировать источники, ставить ссылки и указывать автора. Это нужно даже не для соблюдения авторских прав, а чтобы, при необходимости,  всегда можно было найти исходный источник информации. \n\n\n\nСоздавайте маленькие строительные блоки. Это могут быть сохранённые твиты, записи из дневника, цитаты из книг и статей, фото, сообщения в мессенджерах, собственные статьи в блоге и другие.\n\n\n\nБерегите эти сокровища, перемешивайте и создавайте что-нибудь новое.\n\n\n\nЧто дальше?\n\n\n\nЭта статья не претендует на звание полноценного руководства по методу Building A Second Brain.
